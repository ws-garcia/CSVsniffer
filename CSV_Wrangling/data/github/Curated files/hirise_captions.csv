OBSERVATION_ID	LONG_CAPTION
2 of them	HiRISE has imaged Victoria three times, and shown is a combination of two of those views. The red-colored image is TRA_000873_1780 ( http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/TRA/TRA_000873_1780/) and was acquired with MRO pointed 3.84 degrees to the west. The blue-color image is PSP_001414_1780 ( http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/PSP_001414_1780/) and was acquired with MRO pointed 16.2 degrees to the west. To see the topography, view this image through glasses with a red filter for your left eye, and a blue or blue-green filter for your right eye. The difference in viewing angle between the two images is about 12 degrees, greater than the convergence angle between the left and right eyes of humans while viewing distant objects, so the vertical relief appears much steeper than is actually the case. While some of the cliffs around the crater are in fact vertical, the slopes below the cliffs are no steeper than 30 degrees.
ESP_011268_2485	Shown here is one of a series of images design to monitor <a href='images/2008/details/cut/ESP_011268_2485_cut.jpg'><strong>the Phoenix landing site</strong></a> for changes over time due to atmospheric haze, deposition or removal of dust, or formation of frost as winter approaches.<br><br>Frost is not yet apparent here during the middle afternoon, but there is atmospheric haze. This is the first image targeted to the lander since it ceased activity. <br><br>A previous image was acquired after the lander had ceased communication, but had been planned while it was still active. <br><br>
ESP_011277_1825	This image shows layered sedimentary rocks and ripples that fill and surround an impact crater in Meridiani Planum. These layered deposits may have formed through the accumulation of sediment that were transported into this crater by blowing wind or flowing water.<br><br>The crater interior contains a sequence of layers that are remnants of the material that originally infilled the crater. These sediments form an extensive deposit that once covered the floor of the surrounding region.
ESP_011287_2165	This fresh crater is located in the northern mid-latitudes. It is designated as fresh because of its very sharp rim.<br><br>The crater has experienced some modification since it formed, including a few tiny craters on the south wall.<br><br>The rough texture of the floor is suggestive of ground ice, which is expected to exist in the mid-latitudes. Ground ice aids gravity in moving material from the crater walls towards the center.  Material is visible slumping off the northwest crater wall in this fashion. The wavy texture of the center of the crater floor suggests that material has been transported from the walls and merged in the center. 
ESP_011289_1950	Scamander Vallis is a winding, degraded valley network in the northern hemisphere of Mars. Visible here are several bends, or meanders, in the valley. The bottom of the valley contains dunes, and the scene is speckled with small impact craters.<br><br>The walls of the valley have slope streaks ranging in color from dark to light. Slope streaks are proposed to form by avalanching dust and to evolve by fading or brightening over time. Thus, the slope streaks in Scamander Vallis likely formed at different times.<br><br>Across the center of image, there are some dark streaks that go across the valley walls; these are probably dust devil tracks. As dust devils (mini wind funnels) move across the surface, they stir up dust and leave behind dark trails.
ESP_011292_1720	This image shows the geologic contact between the walls of Ganges Chasma and the adjacent plains. Ganges Chasma is one of several deep troughs that make up the Valles Marineris system on Mars. <br><br>The upper slopes of the walls of Ganges have layering that appears dark, rough, and blocky, consistent with lava flows that are thought to make up the plains around Valles Marineris. Outside of Ganges on the plains is an unusual deposit that appears bright and is eroding back from the walls of Ganges, indicating the deposit isn‚Äôt as resistant to erosion by the wind as the underlying lava flows.<br><br>The bright deposit is mantled by aeolian debris and dust, but along cliffs where erosion has exposed fresher surfaces, one can see meter-scale layering that appears smoother and brighter than the layering visible in the underlying lava flows. Some scientists interpret the layers in this deposit to be sediments laid down by water activity from a channel system located to the west, but explosive volcanism and aeolian airfall can also produce this fine-scale layering.<br>
ESP_011310_1395	This image features the floor of a crater in the southern highlands of Mars.<br><br>The light-toned layered deposits (LTLD) are located in the center of the image; they are exposed along the edges of the high-standing mesa. LTLD are found in many places on Mars, including impact craters and canyons near the equator. They may have been deposited by sedimentary processes involving wind and/or water.<br><br>Dunes or ripples surround the mesa. The orientation of the dunes indicates that the direction of the dominant wind at the time of the dune/ripple formation was along the troughs that surround the mesa.<br><br>The terrain near the bottom of the image has a texture that geologists call ‚Äúetched.‚Äù The etched texture is a result of differential erosion as some materials being eroded more easily than others. One possible scenario is that the region was buried by a soft sedimentary deposit that is now being removed by wind erosion.<br><br>
ESP_011331_1560	Eberswalde Crater is an approximately 65 kilometer diameter, closed basin crater. This image was targeted in the landing ellipse as a possible site for the 2011 <a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> mission. <br><br>The image shows resistant knobs and mounds and a scoured surface. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected phyllosilicates (clays) in the region. Clays on Earth are often formed in the presence of water and occur in river deltas and lake beds. The delta and meandering channels in Eberswalde Crater (west of the landing ellipse) and the detection of phyllosilicates provides evidence for possible past water activity on Mars.<br>
ESP_011341_0980	During the Martian winter a layer of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) forms a seasonal cap over the polar region. In the spring‚Äîwhen the sun starts to warm the ice and the surface below‚Äîgas escapes from beneath the ice layer, carrying dust with it.<br><br>The dust is deposited on top of the ice in fans, with an orientation determined by the prevailing wind direction. In this region, the gas flows along radial channels, so that when it emerges we see a circular set of dust fans. These inspire the ‚Äústarburst‚Äù description. <br>
ESP_011351_0945	Every southern winter the south polar region of Mars is covered with an approximately 1 meter deep layer of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice). In the spring, when the sun begins to warm the surface below the translucent ice, gas flow under the ice carries loose dust from the surface up onto the top.<br><br>The dust falls to the surface in fans, whose orientation is determined by the direction of the local wind flow. Fans from one source region pointing in multiple directions show how the wind direction has changed. Narrow fans pointing in just one direction are the most recent. Alternatively, the vent from the surface may have re-annealed, such that these fans were formed over a very limited time span.
ESP_011386_2065	This HiRISE image shows a collapse pit in Tractus Fossae, a region of large ridges and troughs created by tectonic activity. <br><br>The fossae occur on the Tharsis volcanic rise, a giant region of enhanced volcanic activity that includes the three large volcanoes Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. <br><br>The pit in this image has very steep walls, and so only a narrow arc is illuminated by sunlight. The rest of the pit is in dark shadow. However, <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_011386_2065_cut.jpg'><strong>a stretched version of the image</strong></a> shows details of the pit floor, due to a small amount of scattered sunlight.<br><br>Pits like this form by collapse into underground voids, such as those left by propagating magma-filled dikes. They may sometimes have overhanging walls, although in this case the walls can be seen and appear nearly vertical. Some similar features are found on Earth: Devil‚Äôs Throat, in Hawaii, is one example. Other similar examples have been imaged on Mars as well. <br>
ESP_011544_0985	This image shows a region known as "Inca City" near the south pole, so named because its rectilinear grid of ridges is reminiscent of the ruins of an ancient city.<br><br>Of course, these ridges are not tumble-down stone walls, but their origin is not known for certain. The ridges most likely have been exhumed by aeolian stripping of overlying material and are not related in origin to the nearby south polar ice deposits.<br><br>One possible formation scenario is the filling of cracks (perhaps produced on the floor of an impact crater) by erosionally-resistant material, such as volcanic rock.  Now, the ridges are muted by overlying material, most likely dust. In this image, taken in southern spring, the ridges are also covered by seasonal carbon dioxide ice. The dark spots are areas where the ice is translucent enough to see the darker material beneath it and/or where darker material beneath the ice has escaped to the surface and is blown by near-surface winds, creating long, dark streaks.<br><br>This image is one in a series of images positioned near this location for the purpose of monitoring these dark spots and streaks throughout southern spring and early summer to ascertain how they form and change as the seasonal ice disappears.<br>
ESP_011605_1170	Malea Patera is one of a group of ancient volcanoes that ring the Hellas impact basin.<br><br>This HiRISE image was intended to investigate the nature of the volcanic materials at this location. However, the image was taken in early spring for this location in the southern hemisphere and so the ground is covered with bright frost except for some dark splotches found in discrete patches. This is where the sunlight has penetrated the frost and initiated defrosting around discrete spots.<br><br>Clearly something is different about the patches where this defrosting has started before any other locations. One possibility is that these are (frost covered) dark sand dunes that heat up more easily than the surrounding terrain. However, we will need to take a new image in the summer time to really know what is happening here.  <br>
ESP_011618_1885	The <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/'><strong>MRO Context Imager (CTX)</strong></a> team has been discovering many new impact events on Mars, and then they request HiRISE follow-up imaging to confirm an impact origin and to identify and measure the craters.<br><br>Crater clusters are common as these small (typically less than 1 meter diameter) objects break up in the thin Martian air and separate a little bit to make crater clusters up to a few hundred meters wide. <a href='/images/2008/details/cut/ESP_011618_1885_cut.jpg'><strong>The example shown here</strong></a> is the result of an impact that occurred between May 2003 and September 2007.  It was first discovered as a dark spot in a CTX image acquired in March 2008, but later found to be partly visible at the very edge of a CTX image acquired in September 2007. <br><br>A dark spot is not present in the previous image of this location with sufficient resolution to have detected it, acquired by the visible THEMIS camera on Mars Odyssey in May 2003.  Thus the impact might have formed anytime between May 2003 and September 2007.  The dark markings are created by removing or disturbing the surficial dust cover, and so far new impact sites have been discovered only in dust-covered regions of Mars. <br><br>Although small Martian crater clusters are common, this example is unusual because there is a dark line between the two largest craters. We hypothesize that atmospheric breakup coincidentally made two nearly equal-size objects that impacted close together in space and time so the air blasts interacted with each other to disturb the dust along this line. <br><br>Hundreds of these small objects (mostly asteroid fragments) impact Mars per year. A comparable number of small objects impact Earth each year, but explode in the upper reaches of our atmosphere and have no effect on the surface, fortunately for those of us who live here.<br>
ESP_011631_1515	This image shows part of the floor of an impact crater on the northern rim of the giant Hellas Basin.<br><br>Hellas includes the lowest elevations on Mars, and may have once held lakes or seas; layered rock outcrops occur around much of the edge of the basin. At this site, a large impact crater (about 90 kilometers across) was partly filled by layered rocks. These rocks on the crater floor are now eroding and forming strange pits. <br><br>Here, the layers are mostly exposed on a steep slope which cuts across much of the image.  On this slope, they crop out as rocky stripes, some continuous and others not. The material between the stripes is mostly covered by debris, but some areas of exposed rock are visible. The slope is capped by a thick, continuous layer that armors it against erosion; once this cap is gone, the lower material is removed rapidly, forming the steep slope. At the base of this slope, rocks on the floor of the pit appear bright and heavily fragmented by cracks known as joints. <br><br>The variation in rock types suggests that the rocks here were deposited by multiple processes or in different environments. Sites like this may preserve a record of conditions on early Mars.<br><br>
ESP_011635_1510	The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_011600_011699/ESP_011635_1510/ESP_011635_1510_IRB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>enhanced color image</strong></a> of this observation includes some interesting features in and near the central uplift of Ritchey Crater.<br><br>At the top is an ancient streambed, and above center are multicolored rocks and minerals in the central uplift. Large impact craters are unstable when they are formed, because their walls are so steep. Gravity causes the walls to collapse toward the center of the crater, colliding to form an uplift or peak. This process of central uplift formation can bring rocks from deep in the crater walls up to the surface.<br><br>The angular bright blocks near the center of this image show that this process breaks the wall rocks into fragments as the central uplift is formed.
ESP_011648_1730	This oval mesa is a remnant of a geological unit that once covered this area, similar to the mesas and buttes in Monument Valley, in Arizona and Utah. This is a small remnant of a much larger unit of similar material that caps Ganges Mensa to the west.<br><br>As can be seen in the sides of this small mesa, this remnant consists of a layered stack of rock.  Prior to the massive erosion that left this a high-standing mesa, a more gentle phase of erosion created the small hills and whorls on the upper surface of the mesa. It seems that this gentle erosion continued even after the mesa was created, as this pattern of small hills and whorls is visible on the terrain surrounding the mesa.<br><br>Although not visible in the area shown in this HiRISE image, this mesa actually sits on top of the much larger Ganges Mensa, which is itself a large mesa within Ganges Chasma.<br>
ESP_011664_2015	This image is located at the foot of the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_011600_011699/ESP_011664_2015/ESP_011664_2015_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The entire scene</strong></a> is covered with a multitude of lava flows. Most of the flows consisted of relatively sticky lava that froze after flowing for only a short distance (often less than a kilometer, or about half a mile).  However, a few of the flows were more fluid and actually drained out of their channels, leaving troughs with distinct levees. These ‚Äúchannelized‚Äù flows extend out of the HiRISE image so they must be at least several kilometers (a few miles) long.  <br><br>In all likelihood, both the short and long lava flows have very similar chemical compositions. Based on experience with lava flows on Earth, the channelized flows were probably fed by more vigorous eruptions. That is, the lava flow was fed so quickly that the lava traveled a long distance before it solidified. With the shorter flows, a slow dribble of lava froze before going more than the equivalent of a few city blocks.  <br><br>The ridge with <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_011664_2015_cut.jpg'><strong>two knobs in the center of the image</strong></a> is of special interest. The lava flows radiate away from these knobs, indicating that the flows were fed from these points. However, based on experience with the current eruption of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, it seems that these vents were fed by a lava tube. Thus the magma first reached the surface some distance away, then was transported through a tube to this location. A blockage in the tube would force the lava to burst out and erupt onto the surface.<br>
ESP_011677_1655	This contains a series of craters called pit chains; however they are not formed by impact craters.<br><br>There are a few potential ways that these are formed. The pit craters are believed to form by the collapse of lava tubes or magma chambers. They could also form when the crust of Mars gets pulled apart by extensional forces from a growing volcano magma chamber. This leaves structurally weak areas that have a greater chance of collapsing when the area (lava tubes or magma chamber) no longer contains molten lava or is drained from the chamber. <br><br>There is evidence that Mars is not the only planet that has features like these. Earth also has similar pit chains that have formed in Iceland. This chain was formed on a known fault line and the pits formed when the region experienced an earthquake. <br><br>This process may be similar to the way the Martian pit chains were formed. If "Marsquakes" are the cause of the formation of pit chains, this will support the idea that there is still geologic (tectonic) activity occurring on Mars. The pit chains that have been found on Earth are considerably smaller than similar features that are found on Mars. Earth‚Äôs are smaller due to higher gravity and weathering makes them smaller and at some point completely erasing them from sight. But Mars has no system to create erosion; therefore the chains on Mars are better preserved. <br><br><strong>Related links</strong><br><a href=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6226157/><strong>Seismic study hints at a rumbling Mars</strong></a><br><a href=http://www.marstoday.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=15398><strong>Pit chain formation on Mars</strong></a><br>
ESP_011765_1780	<a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_011765_1780_cut.jpg'><strong>This subimage,</a></strong> about 400 meters across, shows the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity (circled at lower left).  <br><br>The image was taken during the afternoon of Opportunity‚Äôs 1783rd sol (Mars day) on the Red Planet. Opportunity had driven 130 m on the previous sol; wheel tracks are visible crossing dark ripples to the upper right of the rover. The ripples, which trend mostly north-south in this area, can be easily crossed by the rover unless they are very large (such as those right of center).  <br><br>The availability of HiRISE images of the terrain that Opportunity is crossing allow traverses to be planned in detail, avoiding potential hazards and targeting features of interest (such as the small craters below and left of center). HiRISE images are routinely used by the Opportunity operations team for these purposes, and to plan the route to distant Endeavour Crater, the long-term goal of Opportunity‚Äôs mission, about 17 km to the southeast.<br><br>Opportunity has been exploring Mars for over 5 (Earth) years; it will probably take another two years to reach Endeavour.<br>
ESP_011834_1605	This HiRISE image of the Solis Planum region shows a relatively recent impact crater. The crater, about 400 meters across, displays numerous meter-scale and larger rocks.<br><br>These rocks are located on the crater wall and splayed out radially on the surrounding plains. The latter boulders are part of the ejecta, material blasted out of the Martian crust by the impact. The fact that the boulders are well preserved is evidence that the crater is fairly young.<br><br>Nevertheless, some ripples are visible on the crater floor, indicating that wind has had time to mobilize fine particles (sand and granules) into bedforms.<br>
ESP_011842_0980	Marsí seasonal cap of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) has eroded many beautiful terrains as it sublimates (goes directly from ice to vapor) every spring. In this region we see troughs that form a starburst pattern.<br><br>In other areas these radial troughs have been referred to as ìspiders,î simply because of their shape. In this region the pattern looks more dendritic as channels branch out numerous times as they get further from the center. The troughs are believed to be formed by gas flowing beneath the seasonal ice to openings where the gas escapes, carrying along dust from the surface below. The dust falls to the surface of the ice in fan-shaped deposits.<br>
ESP_011878_1045	SHARAD (Shallow Subsurface Radar) looks for liquid or frozen water in the first few hundreds of feet (up to 1 kilometer) of Mars' crust.<br><br>SHARAD probes the subsurface using radar waves within a 15- to 25-megahertz frequency band to get the desired, high-depth resolution.<br><br>The radar wave return, which is captured by the SHARAD antenna, is sensitive to changes in the electrical reflection characteristics of rock, sand, and any water that may be present in the surface and subsurface. Water, like high-density rock, is highly conducting, and has a very strong radar return. Changes in the reflection characteristics of the subsurface, caused by layers deposited by geological processes in the ancient history of Mars, are also visible.<br>
ESP_011909_1320	This HiRISE image shows two classes of aeolian bedforms within Proctor Crater. The relatively bright, small ridges are ripples. From their study on Earth, and close-up examination by the MER rovers (roving elsewhere on Mars), we know that ripples are composed of fine sand (less than 200 microns in diameter) or fine sand coated with coarser sand and granules.<br><br>The larger, darker bedforms are dunes composed of sand, most likely of fine size. Ripples tend to move slower than dunes. Because of this, over time, ripples get covered with dust, possibly explaining the bright tone visible here. The dunes are dark probably because they are composed of basaltic sand (derived from dark, volcanic rock) that is blown by the wind enough that dust does not sufficiently accumulate to change their color.<br><br>This area in Proctor Crater is being monitored by HiRISE to document any changes over time.<br>
ESP_011934_0945	Every winter, Mars‚Äô polar region is covered with a layer of seasonal carbon dioxide ice (dry ice). In the spring jets of gas carry dust from the ground up through openings in the ice. The dust gets carried downwind by the prevailing wind and falls on top of the seasonal ice layer in a fan-shaped deposit.<br><br>Many jets appear to be active at the same time since numerous fans are all deposited in the same direction: this image is an example of such an occurrence. At the top of this image the fans are oriented in one direction while at the bottom they are going in a different direction.  This suggests that as the ice layer thins, a set of gas jets becomes active, they die down, then further away another set starts up at a later time with a different prevailing wind direction.<br>
ESP_011966_1700	Oudemans Crater is about 120 kilometers in diameter and it is located in western Valles Marineris just to the south of Noctis Labyrinthus.<br><br>Light-toned layering is visible in the central peak which represents material brought up from substantial depth (greater than 6 km) and provide evidence for older deposits buried beneath the lava flows of the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Mars'><strong>Hesperian-aged</strong></a> plains. <br><br>In this HiRISE image, which is located to the east of the central peak but along the floor of the crater, numerous hills are visible. The <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_011966_1700_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage reveals layered rocks</strong></a> in the hills that are tilted so that they stand almost vertically. The rocks were originally laid down horizontally so the force and uplift during formation of the crater peaks caused sections of the rocks to be broken apart and rotated.<br>
ESP_011995_1410	This southern hemisphere crater has gullies on its north and northeast walls. Gullies are proposed to be carved by liquid water originating from the subsurface or melting ice/snow on the surface. <br><br>Arcuate ridges, wave-shaped high-standing features, are located downslope of the gullies here.  This happens frequently on Mars, although it is unknown whether the formation of gullies and arcuate ridges are related to each other.<br><br>Dark dunes are visible on the crater floor. Lighter, smaller dunes rim the south side of the crater floor. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_011900_011999/ESP_011995_1410/ESP_011995_1410_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The entire scene</strong></a> has a pitted texture, suggesting that ground ice was once present in this region. When ground ice sublimates (goes from a solid directly to a gas), it leaves behind empty spaces in the soil that turn into pits as the remaining overlying soil collapses to fill them.<br>
ESP_012065_9000	HiRISE captured these enhanced-color images of Deimos, the smaller of the two moons of Mars, on 21 February 2009. <br><br>Deimos has a smooth surface due to a blanket of fragmental rock or regolith, except for the most recent impact craters.  It is a dark, reddish object, very similar to Phobos, shown here in enhanced HiRISE colors (near-infrared, red, and blue-green). HiRISE took <a href='phobos.php'><strong>images of Phobos</strong></a> on 23 March 2008.<br><br>There are subtle color variations‚Äîredder in the smoothest areas and less red near fresh impact craters and over ridges or topographic highs (relative to its center of gravity).

ESP_012252_1245	This image is located in a crater in the Hellespontus region that displays dunes and dust devil tracks.<br><br>The larger barchan-like dunes are surrounded by linear ripples and dark coarse material. The dunes are composed of basaltic sands that have accumulated in the troughs of the dunes. The dunes themselves run in a northeast to southwest direction. The steep west facing slip face indicates that the dune is controlled by a southeasterly direction and that the winds here tend to blow from left to right.<br><br>Both the sandy and rough textured surfaces are crisscrossed by the tracks of dust devils. These tracks form when dust devils abrade the surface exposing the underlying darker surface. The tracks appear to be clustered since dust devils frequently form in areas that have been previously scoured. The lighter tracks are older tracks that are fading or have been overprinted by other dust devils. <br><br>It is possible that the dunes are stable as many of the dust devils appear to be going to the southeast direction (based on scallop patterns- dust devil leaves behind dark circular patterns and erase the frost as it moves forward by local winds). This is an indication of change of wind especially since the dune field is in a crater.<br><br>Note: this caption was written by NAU student Addie Hite.<br>
ESP_012270_2035	This HiRISE image is part of the Olympica Fossae in the Tharsis region of Mars.<br><br>Tharsis is most famous for being the home of the four largest volcanoes in the Solar System. However, the region also hosts a variety of other geologic features formed as the ground deformed under the tremendous weight of the volcanoes.<br><br>Most of the fissures (or ‚Äúfossae‚Äù) in the region are primarily places where the ground was pulled apart.  However, the Olympica Fossae are somewhat different. They are oriented at an angle to the other fissures suggesting that some other process was important in their formation.  A close-up image reveals that erosion by one or more catastrophic floods may have played a key role.<br><br>The teardrop shaped islands and the parallel ridges are rock left standing after the flood erosion. However, the deepest depression running basically east-west through the middle of the image was probably caused by tectonic extension, not flood erosion. This juxtaposition of tectonic and flood-carved valleys is visible elsewhere on Mars, suggesting that it may be common for the tectonic fracturing to release copious volumes of subterranean water.<br><br>
ESP_012271_0940	This image represents a Martian terrain containing ‚ÄúSwiss cheese‚Äù features. This terrain is found only within the residue of the southern polar cap, which comprises of mostly frozen carbon dioxide and water. <br><br>These particular features are flat-floored, circular depressions that are believed to form from different rates in the seasonal changes of the carbon dioxide and water ices. Varying rates in sublimation‚Äîwhen these ices change directly to vapors upon heat and back to deposited solids upon cooling‚Äîproduces these rimmed depressions from the flat polar ice plane. It is hypothesized that the depression areas are made up of dry ice, carbon dioxide, and the material below consists of the water ice. <br><br>This carbon dioxide solid rises and slightly evaporates into the thin atmosphere in the summer while the water layer remains in place. As the south pole cools with seasonal change, the ‚ÄúSwiss cheese‚Äù formation is obtained with risen carbon dioxide rimmed depressions and flat water mesas. The Martian north pole will evaporate all of its carbon dioxide in the summer; however the south pole is colder and this may explain why this terrain is only found in this area.<br><br>Some of the circular features <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_012200_012299/ESP_012271_0940/ESP_012271_0940_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>in the full image</strong></a> show distinct cusps that point in the direction of the pole. These cusps suggest insolation, a measure of solar radiation that is pushing the movement/formation of these depressions away from the pole. There is also an observed lateral outward growth of the features at the rate of about one-to-three meters a year, indicating to scientists that the depressions must form in a carbon dioxide medium.<br><br>Note: this caption was written by NAU student  Alexandre Scott.
ESP_012310_1715	This long pit on the western flank of the Arsia Mons volcano shows a thick stack of volcanic layers.<br><br>This is probably a collapse pit that formed in a similar manner to how such pits form in Hawaii. Underlying large volcano complexes there is a large lava ‚Äúplumbing system.‚Äù  While active, these lava tubes can support the weight of overlying solidified lava layers.  However, when volcanic activity slows down, and lava drains away, these lava tubes empty and often collapse.<br><br>Scientists can study the layers in the pit walls to learn things about the eruptions that built the volcano in this area.
ESP_012425_1455	This circular feature is a collection of hills, with some connected by ridges.<br><br>The circularity suggests that perhaps there was once an impact crater here that was subsequently filled with material which  was somehow more resistant to erosion than the landscape around it.<br><br>Over time, as erosion stripped away the ground, the fill material was left standing higher (although it has clearly been eroded as well).
ESP_012435_2015	The dark branched features in the floor of Antoniadi Crater look like giant ferns, or fern casts.

ESP_012692_1810	Pavonis Mons is one of the three giant Tharsis Montes shield volcanoes. Its summit rises so far above the surface that the atmosphere is extremely thin, even for Mars.<br><br>Dust that reaches these heights (for example, during major dust storms) is hard to remove, so the upper parts of these volcanoes are covered by vast deposits of dust. The dust is moved a little by the thin winds, producing ripples and other textures near the limit of HiRISE‚Äôs resolution. The fluffy, ripply surface looks ‚Äúsmudged‚Äù or out of focus, but by looking at some of the small impact craters you can see that the HiRISE camera is, indeed, properly focused. It‚Äôs the surface of Mars that is blurry!  <br><br>The impact craters also show that the dust is not a thin veneer. Instead, it is a thick coat, at least several meters (yards) deep. This mantling of dust hides the details of the lava flows and vents, frustrating volcanologists but delighting those who study dust!

ESP_012774_1080	This image shows a portion of the dunes that fill Richardson Crater, a 55 kilometer diameter crater in the south polar region of Mars and a frequent repeat target for the HiRISE camera. <br><br>During southern fall and winter, these dunes are coated with seasonal carbon dioxide frost, which then sublimates (goes directly from a solid to a gas) into the atmosphere as the temperature rises in spring and summer.<br><br>The <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_012774_1080_cut.jpg'><strong>enhanced-color subimage</strong></a> shows a boundary between dunes that are mostly covered with seasonal frost and dunes that have mostly thawed.

ESP_012853_1480	This image shows a network of small valleys in the Terra Cimmeria region of the Martian southern highlands.

The bedrock is pervasively fractured, and some of the fractures appear to be filled with material of a different color, possibly composed of minerals that crystallized or were cemented together when fluids (perhaps water) circulated through the fractures. <br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_012853_1480_cut.jpg'><strong>On the right side of the subimage</strong></a> is a valley filled with dark material and a central, bright ridge.  If the valley was carved by liquid water, then this ridge may mark a former stream channel where coarse-grained sediment was deposited, which has survived erosion more effectively than the finer-grained sediment in the valley outside the channel.<br><br>Similar ìinverted channelî deposits are visible elsewhere on Mars, and some examples in the southern highlands have been inferred to contain chloride salts (similar to table salt).  The color and texture of the possible inverted channels in this image are similar to those inferred to contain chlorides, which may have been deposited when salty water evaporated. <br><br>Considered together, the features in this image attest to a history of water-related activity at this location on Mars.<br>
ESP_012873_1075	This image features the north wall and floor of a polar pit in the southern hemisphere.  <br><br>The pit wall is sculpted into a row of gullies. Gullies typically have a triangular start upslope, followed by a channel that transported material, and a triangular debris fan downslope. Polar pit gullies might be related to seasonal changes in frost coverage, but their exact origin is currently unknown. The gullies appear bright because they probably have seasonal frost on them.<br><br>The pit floor contains a field of dark sand dunes. Wind has transported sand across the Martian surface, and it was deposited in this pit and formed dunes. Some of the sand in the dunes might have come from the gully debris fans or other erosion of the pit wall.<br><br>The bright material within the dunes and along the floor is seasonal frost that is probably composed of carbon dioxide and water ice.<br>

ESP_012934_1070	This image shows an outcrop of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). The SPLD consist of layers of ice and admixed dust and make up the bulk of the dome-shaped Planum Australe.<br><br>Planum Australe is, in some ways, analogous to the Antarctic ice sheet. Troughs and scarps carved into Planum Australe by erosional processes have exposed SPLD layers within it. In this image, the darkest area at the bottom of the image is the bottom of the scarp. Except for the dark material at the bottom of the slope, much of the changes in brightness in this image are due to the lighting angle, the direction from which the sun is illuminating the slope. <br><br>Much like ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica and deep sea sediment cores, the icy-dusty layers of the SPLD may have preserved a record of recent Mars climate history. Understanding that record is a complex process and involves, among many other types of analyses, examining the differences and similarities in appearance between each layer and attempting to classify layer types. This image shows nice examples of different layer textures. But what is especially interesting about this image are the faults cutting through the layers. These faults appear as diagonal lines, on either side of which, the layering is offset.  Note that the faults are not clean, single lines, but appear in long groups of short lines.<br><br>What caused these faults is still under investigation, but, among other possibilities, they could be related to an earlier time when temperatures were higher and the ice was flowing at a much faster rate than it is today.<br>
ESP_012940_1655	The scoured and scabby floor of Eos Chasma, located east of Valles Marineris, is covered with dunes or ripples and eroded craters.

ESP_012941_0930	This HiRISE image is located on the carbon-dioxide rich residual south polar ice cap near 86 degrees South, 353 degrees East.

ESP_012997_1445	This image shows two craters in the southern hemisphere just south of Sirenum Fossae.<br><br>The northern  crater is smaller, appears more degraded, and is partially filled with sediments that form a hummocky surface. Dunes have formed subsequently on this surface.  Some incipient gully-like features have formed midway along the southern crater wall and expose layers that are more resistant to erosion.<br><br>The larger crater to the south is eroded by gullies on its northern slope while the southern slope region lacks them. Most gullies in this scene appear to emanate from more resistant layers, although the larger gullies have eroded back almost to the crater rim.  <br><br>The nature of the layers and their connection to the water that formed the gullies is unknown. Gullies typically form when flowing water erodes sediments and soft rocks in a channelized flow. Because Mars is very cold and dry, it is unknown where the water came from to form the gullies.<br>

ESP_013049_0950	This image is part of an ongoing seasonal monitoring effort in this location in the southern polar region of Mars.<br><br>Mars‚Äô south polar region changes significantly during the Martian year. During the southern hemisphere‚Äôs winter, the polar cap increases dramatically as the lowered temperatures make a large portion of the atmosphere freeze out into ice. As spring approaches and the polar region begins to warm once again, the cap recedes revealing terrains like those visible in this image.<br><br>The polygonal features in this image are termed ‚Äúspiders‚Äù and their origin is still unknown (although there are several hypotheses). One possible hypothesis for the black fan-shaped features is that they may be formed by a geyser-like process. As the sun heats the ground layer below the carbon dioxide ice, the ice on the bottom begins  to sublimate, or turn directly from a solid to a gas. This gas then builds up in pressure as more of it sublimates, until a critical pressure is achieved and it erupts through the ice layer much as a geyser would, spewing the debris that is thought to make up the dark fan shaped features.<br>

ESP_013089_2040	This image is of the ejecta blanket of the Tooting Crater in the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Tooting is a "rampart" crater that is roughly 29 kilometers (18 miles) in diameter and appears to be one of the youngest craters of this size. A rampart crater is one where the material ejected from the crater during impact forms lobes that end with a low ridge, or rampart. One indication of Tooting Crater's youth is its ratio of depth to width. As a crater ages, the walls of the crater will tend to erode and debris will accumulate in the crater's floor making its apparent depth less, while also making its width larger.<br><br>One of the major features of Tooting Crater are its multiple ejecta layers that <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_013000_013099/ESP_013089_2040/ESP_013089_2040_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>build a sequence of ramparts.</strong></a> The shapes of these ramparts suggest that the ejected material acted as a fluid (like mud) as it moved across the surface. Most researchers think that such fluid ejecta indicates that there was ice in the ground when the crater formed.<br><br>
ESP_013144_2075	This image is of the flanks of the shield volcano Elysium Mons.<br><br>The volcano is considered to be the youngest within the Elysium Mons province, which also contains the volcanoes Hecates, Tholus, and Albor Tholus.<br><br>Of course, "young" is a relative term. The last eruption of Elysium Mons could well have been a billion years or more ago.<br><br>This image shows a series of flat bottomed valleys along the flanks of Elysium Mons. There is considerable debate on exactly how these valleys form. In Hawaii, the classic example of shield volcanoes on Earth, similar valleys are carved by prodigious rainfall. While some rain may have fallen in the earliest epochs of Mars' geologic history, the lack of small drainage networks shows that these Martian channels were not carved by rain.<br><br>However, mudflows and lava flows could potentially erode the sides of the volcano. An important hint for the origin of the valleys comes from the chain of pits <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_013100_013199/ESP_013144_2075/ESP_013144_2075_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>visible in the northern part of the image.</a></strong> These pits form as the ground is pulled apart by Marsquakes. Thus it seems that many of these valleys are first formed by movement along faults. Then mud and/or lava flows widen the sides of the valley and give it a flat floor.<br>

ESP_013329_1070	This image of Mars' south polar area shows an amazing series of elliptical rings. Could these have been made by a Zamboni on Mars driving around and around on the ice? No, of course not! But the answer in some ways more fun.  <br><br>The ice caps on Mars are surrounded by a thick stack of layered deposits. HiRISE and other instruments have shown that these layers are composed of dusty ice. Imagine this stack of layers as a cake with alternating layers. Now someone comes and takes a big scoop out of the middle of the cake!  While our first reaction might be to get mad at them for ruining the cake, take a moment to think what the pattern would look like: it would have rings going round and round the hole.  This is what we are seeing in this image of Mars.<br><br>Some erosional process has scooped a big hole into the layered deposits. So, no Zamboni, but we do have giant scoops digging into layer-cakes of ice!
ESP_013348_1185	This dune field is on the floor of a small crater in Noachis Terra located in the southern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>The slip faces of the dunes have multiple directions, indicating that there were several wind directions and changes in wind strength when the dunes formed. The dominant dune type are transverse dunes (oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction), with modified barchans (crescent-shaped dunes) in the northern region of the field and incipient linear dunes in the southern region.<br><br>The bright material scattered throughout the dune troughs, as well as at the bottom of the image, are outcrops of underlying bedrock.<br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013348_1185_cut.jpg'><strong>The bottom of the image clearly displays</strong></a> a mass of dark dust devil tracks.  Dust devils are wind funnels that suck up dust as they travel over the surface exposing the dark sandy substrate.<br>
ESP_013368_1035	HiRISE has helped the successful Mars Exploration Rovers and Phoenix Lander by giving these teams an "eye-in-the-sky" view. We are also trying to help understand why some missions were not successful.<br><br>One such mission was the Mars Polar Lander which went permanently silent after entering the Martian atmosphere in December 1999. It is speculated that the landing sequence failed when the legs were deployed and accidentally reported that the lander was on the ground. As a consequence, the parachute was cut while the lander was actually hundreds of feet in the air.<br><br>This HiRISE image is one of a sequence searching for either the parachute or the crumpled lander on the ground.  However, we expect the debris from this mission to be covered with dust and ice, making it a challenge to identify them.  The more eyes that search these images the better, so try your luck!<br><br>Most of the surface is covered with patches of small channels. It is thought that these have been carved by vaporized ice. On Mars, the ice goes straight to a gas  (a process called "sublimation") rather than first melting.  So, as the ice heats in the spring and summer, gas is generated and flows under the remaining ice. This flowing gas can move dust and slowly carve a small channels.<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> We appreciate the heavy interest this can bring, but we cannot promise to answer each inquiry individually.

ESP_013368_1885	This observation shows a lava plain near the Martian equator. The lava is superposed by a small, fresh crater that is itself surrounded by boulders that were ejected from the surface when the impact occurred. <br><br>There are dunes on the crater floor, indicating that the crater has been present long enough for wind to blown fine material into the crater and form the material into dunes.
ESP_013499_1650	One of the science objectives of this observation was to try to capture the same dust devil in both cameras simultaneously by coordinated HiRISE and MER Spirit observations.<br><br>Surprisingly few dust plumes and dust devil tracks have been observed by HiRISE in Gusev Crater, in comparison to the number of dust devils seen by the rover. Obtaining both ground-based and orbital imagery will allow scientists to better understand the formation, physical properties, and behavior of the dust devils at the MER Spirit landing site.<br><br>During these coordinated observations, Spirit observed several small dust devils and a large dust devil in the flat plains northwest of its current position on the western scarp of a polygonal feature commonly called Home Plate. On the other hand, the HiRISE camera <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013499_1650_cut_b.jpg'><strong>did not detect an active dust devil</strong></a> nor the track that dust devils often leave behind. However, <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013499_1650_cut.jpg'><strong>a dust devil plume was captured</strong></a> east of Columbia Hills that was about 17 meters in diameter! The top ìL-curveî is the track left behind, and the bottom ìL-curveî is the shadow of the plume. With changing winds, the dust devil is moving in a direction different than when it formed. It may be that only the largest of the Gusev Crater dust devils can be easily seen by HiRISE.<br><br><strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>Ground-based (Mars Exploration Rover) MER and orbital MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) HiRISE observations indicate that the low albedo zone in Gusev Crater is currently an active area for the formation of dust devils.<br><br>Dust devils are convecting warm-core vortices that form when hot surface air rises and is replaced by the radial inflow of surrounding cool air. This rising vertical column of swirling warm air creates a low pressure core. The low pressure core acts like a vacuum that picks up fine particles that mantle the surface and exposes the dark basaltic substrate in a narrow track.<br><br>Subimage credit: Devin Waller, Arizona State University (for Spirit coordination).<br>

ESP_013726_1475	This HiRISE image shows a sample of the variety and complexity of processes that may occur on the walls of Martian craters, well after the impact crater formed.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_013700_013799/ESP_013726_1475/ESP_013726_1475_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>At the very top of the image</strong></a> is the high crater rim; at the bottom of the image is the crater's central peak - a dome of material rising above the surrounding crater floor uplifted during the impact event.<br><br>Reaching down the walls of the crater are windy and crooked troughs, or gullies. Some of these gullies may have formed with the help of liquid water, melted from ice or snowpack on the crater walls or from groundwater within the walls. Also notable is the long tongue-like lobe stretching down the middle of the image, with a darker, rounded snout, and prominent parallel grooves on its surface. These characteristics, together with faint cracks on its surface, suggest that this lobe may have formed by movement of ice-rich material from up on the crater wall down to the crater floor.<br><br>Because surface features on this lobe, as well as most gullies, do not appear sharp and pristine, and wind-blown dunes have blown up on the front snout of the lobe, and because there are several small craters on  the lobe's surface, the movement of ice-rich material, and possibly water, have probably not occurred very recently.<br><br>This image forms a stereo pair with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_013871_1475'>ESP_013871_1475.</strong></a><br>
ESP_013751_1115	This ìetch-a-sketchî appearance indicates the presence of dust devil activity in the Thyles Rupes region of Mars.<br><br>The dark streaks are a result of a surface-atmosphere interaction that creates thermally-driven vortices. These Martian vortices are giant dust devils that ìvacuumî the bright surface dust revealing the darker subsurface rock. <br><br>This image was taken in the late southern summer and shows that the dust devil direction of movement changes with the winds as the season progresses from spring to fall. Dust devils are sensitive to changes in low-speed ambient winds and will follow the dominant daytime wind direction.<br><br>The direction of the vortex is visible by the scallop pattern that is left behind as a dust devil will erase the front part of the circular track as it follows the wind.<br>
ESP_013785_1300	This dune field in Aonia Terra shows sand dunes with a variety of morphologies.<br><br>These complex shapes often indicate that the dominating winds change direction, either over time or from one location to the next. Many of the dune fields in this region of Mars are banked up against topographic obstacles such as crater rims. The location of the dunes within impact craters gives an indication of the average regional winds, while details such as slip-face orientations and superposed ripples are controlled by the present day local winds.<br><br>The outlying dunes in this image appear as simple arc-shaped barchans formed by southerly winds. As the dunes migrated northwards, they encountered other dunes crowded against a confining scarp. Many of the barchans climbed up onto the upwind (stoss) slope of the next row of dunes. This migration is shown by the avalanches that have occurred on the downwind (slip) face of the dunes. The collision of the dunes altered the morphology of the barchans to star-shaped dunes with multiple arms that took on a linear appearance as the horns were modified. <br><br>There is also the presence of faint dark tracks from dust devils picking up a very thin veneer of dust on the dunes. The faintness of the tracks could be an indication that the dunes have actively saltating sand grains that clean much of the settled dust from the dunes. <br>

ESP_013810_1485	This HiRISE image shows a close-up view of the terrain northeast of Zilair Crater.<br><br>In lower-resolution images, from the Context Camera (also on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter), this area looks quite rough. The reasons for this rough texture are difficult to determine; however, clues from the surrounding area help solve this mystery. Many large impact craters surround this image, but there are no volcanoes nearby making it unlikely that the rough surface is from fresh, blocky lava flows.<br><br>The high-resolution image shown here reveals a few fresh, irregularly-shaped craters on top of this rough terrain.  An irregular crater, approximately 600 meters (2000 feet) in diameter, is visible just right of center, about a third of the way up from the bottom of the image. Its shape suggests that it formed from a body that impacted the surface at a relatively low angle and slow speed. This makes it likely that it is a secondary crater (a crater that forms from debris blasted out of a nearby crater).<br><br>The rough terrain here is therefore likely to be a mix of impact material and secondary craters from nearby impacts, such as the one that formed the nearby large crater Zilair. <br>
ESP_013916_1485	This image views the ground a little over 500 kilometers (300 miles) from Hale Crater, a  125 x 150 kilometer (78 x 93 mile) impact crater located on the northern rim of the Argyre Basin. <br><br>The ground appears to have a linear pattern (somewhat easier to see <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_013900_013999/ESP_013916_1485/ESP_013916_1485_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>viewing the entire image at once</strong></a>) extending from the bottom right to the top left of the image. The linear pattern of the light bedrock is especially evident in nighttime infrared images, where it appears as a series of bright streaks. The pattern points directly back to Hale Crater.  It is most prominent near the crater, outside of the Argyre basin, but a hint of it extends almost to Vallis Marineris, over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) away. <br><br>This image shows areas of bedrock (light areas) that appear to have been grooved or scoured in a uniform direction. Superimposed on this in the low-lying areas are dark areas that consist of small ridges trending in the opposite direction to the scoured bedrock. The dark areas are sand and dust, and the small ridges are  aeolian bedforms (that look like linear sand dunes, averaging approximately 100-300 meters, or 300-1,000 feet)  that cross the image.<br><br>The suggestion that the pattern arises from bedrock that has been scoured along a linear trend away from Hale Crater is interesting because an outward-expanding blast of pulverized debrisñ known as a base surgeñis thought to be one of the features associated with the formation of impact craters. Images such as this may be evidence that base surges are an important part of the impact process.<br>

ESP_013948_1410	This image covers parts of two different craters, both with gullies in the inner walls. Gullies are a popular target because their formation is still being debated.<br><br>The powerful HiRISE camera reveals many details of gullies that have never been seen before. (Searching our catalog for <a href='http://www.uahirise.org/results.php?keyword=gully&submit=Search&lat_point=&lon_point=&latlon_limit=&lat_beg=&lat_end=&lon_beg=&lon_end=&order=release_date'><strong>"gully"</strong></a> or <a href='http://www.uahirise.org/results.php?keyword=gullies&submit=Search&lat_point=&lon_point=&latlon_limit=&lat_beg=&lat_end=&lon_beg=&lon_end=&order=release_date'><strong>"gully"</strong></a> will bring up many, many more images of gullies!) Some hypotheses about the formation of gullies involve the flow of some amount of liquid (water, brine, or some other substance), and others postulate that gullies could be formed by the downhill movement of dry material such as dust or sand. To further complicate things, different gullies could have formed by different methods.<br><br>The many gullies visible in this image look quite different from each other. <a href='http://www.uahirise.org/images/2009/details/cut/ESP_013948_1410_cut1.jpg'><strong>This subimage</strong></a> from the southwestern part of the crater to the south shows a gully with a smaller alcove (source region at the top) and a deep main channel.

However, this gully is marked by a distinct bright-colored deposit along its length.

Most of these have large fan-shaped deposits at the bottom, and a few to the left side of the subimage have bright deposits where new material may have been deposited or exposed. Some of the channels and fans contain ripples; this might be where wind eroded loose material, or it may be a texture that formed as sand or liquid moved down the slope. Some of the gully-like features in this image are more likely dry landslide chutes.<br><br>This is also a good example of how we use lower-resolution data from other missions, like this <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/e07_e12/images/E11/E1101445.html'><strong>previous MOC image</strong></a>, to target the HiRISE camera.

ESP_013951_1955	On 13 October 1659, Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens turned one of his telescopes towards a bright orange spot in the sky and produced what Percival Lowell would later call ìthe first drawing of Mars worthy of the name ever made by man.î Huygens included a dark spot in his drawing that is thought to represent Syrtis Major, a small sliver of which is visible in this HiRISE image.<br><br>Syrtis Major is a shield volcano. Its dark color comes from the dark basaltic rock in the area, visible because it lacks the dust that paints the rest of the planet its distinct, rusty red color. Tracking this dark spot in repeated observations, Huygens concluded that Mars rotated every twenty-four hours: a time not too far off from its true rotation period of approximately 24 hours and 39.58 minutes.<br><br>In this image of Syrtis Major, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Mars'><strong>ancient Noachian bedrock</strong></a> is exposed. This is rock made in the early days of Martian history. An impact crater (about 50 kilometers in diameter, or 30 miles) into this rock exposes layers along its wall. These layers may be made from several different geologic materials, such as lava flows, debris from nearby impact craters, or deposits of dust or sand. They may represent different periods of deposition and erosion. The layers are of varying thickness: some of the lighter, resistant units are less than 10 meters thick, while some of the darker layers are over 100 meters thick.<br>

Since then, dark sand has blown out of Victoria and partially covered the tracks, darkening the surface.<br><br><strong>AN OBLIQUE VIEW OF VICTORIA CRATER</strong><br>Victoria Crater was explored by Opportunity rover for more than a Mars year; HiRISE images have supported surface exploration and contributed to joint scientific studies.<br><br>HiRISE stereo data were used to measure slopes and help select safe paths for the intrepid rover. The most interesting exposures of geologic strata are in the steep walls of the crater, difficult to image from the overhead perspective of orbiting spacecraft like MRO.

ESP_013958_1170	Throughout this entire image in Aonia Terra, it is possible to make out regular polygonally shaped patterns. Here on Earth, wherever ice-rich permafrost occurs (soil which stays frozen throughout the year), the ground may crack and form similar patterns to those we see on Mars.<br><br>Despite remaining below freezing, changes in seasons and ground temperature cause significant thermal-contraction stress, enough so that the terrain fractures into a honeycomb network of subsurface cracks.<br><br>Criss-crossed dark paths wind throughout this region. Dust devils, turbulent whirlwinds fueled by rising ground-warmed atmosphere, track across the surface, stripping the ground of bright surface dust as they go. Comparable to miniature tornadoes, they efficiently transport surface materials on Mars.

Sometimes, these boulders occur in rings, the remnants of an ancient impact whose crater has since eroded to a flat surface.

ESP_014074_1445	This image covers part of the Northwest rim of Hale Crater.  Gullies have formed down the interior rim of the crater in this location.<br><br>While the origin of these gullies is not clear, some have attributes similar to their counterparts on the Earth that result from flowing water. These include upper regions where gully tributaries have eroded into the source rocks, sinuous or "snake-like" channel middle reaches, and down slope regions where gullies distribute and terminate in deposits of sediment and debris.<br><br>Bright material deposits are evident along the walls of some gullies.

ESP_014097_1120	Impact craters that form at high latitudes often disappear faster than those that form in equatorial regions. The craters in this image are only barely detectable. <br><br>Over time, craters in ice, particularly large craters, "relax." Their depth-to-diameter ratio decreases as the bowl of the crater gets shallower with time. The craters slowly appear softer and smoother, fading into the surrounding landscape, until they remain only as circular patterns on flat ground, before they eventually disappear altogether. The larger the crater, the faster it will relax.<br><br>The reason for the crater degradation is partly due to in-filling by snow or dust and slumping off of the crater walls, and also partly from processes that produce the patterned ground you see in this HiRISE image. But the primary reason for the shallowing is because the ground at high latitudes on Mars is ice-rich, and ice is not very strong. At warmer temperatures found in the inner solar system, ice generally flows more easily than rock, so ice cannot support the structure of the crater as well as rock. The crater relaxes as the ice begins to flow back to a level surface.<br><br>All of the processes listed above have likely acted on these craters, and recently, they have also been swept by dust devils, which left dark streaks in their wake.
ESP_014153_1430	Several years ago gullies carved into hill-slopes and the walls of impact craters like the ones pictured here were discovered. Scientists are excited to study these features because, on Earth, they usually form through the action of liquid water - long thought to be absent on the Martian surface. Whether gullies form under today's cold dry conditions is a major question that planetary scientists are trying to answer.<br><br>The gullies pictured here are great examples of what a typical Martian gully looks like. You can see wide V-shaped channels running downhill (from top to bottom) where the material that carved the gully flowed. At the bottom of the channel this material empties out onto a fan-shaped mound. Several gullies are visible here and the fans from each gully overlap one other in complicated ways.<br><br>At the tops of the channels, large amphitheater-shaped alcoves are carved in the rock. The material removed from these alcoves likely flowed downhill to the aprons through the gullies.<br><br>Gullies at this site are especially interesting because scientists recently discovered examples at similar locations to be still active. Images separated by several years showed changes in the appearance of some of these gullies. Today, planetary scientists are using the HiRISE camera to examine gullies for ongoing change and investigate what that might mean for the occurrence of liquid water on the surface of Mars.<br>
ESP_014159_1670	Many channels formed by water (when the climate of Mars was very different to that of today) cut the ancient highlands of Mars. Water running through these channels picks up rocky debris and carries it or rolls it along the channel bed. Occasionally these channels will empty into a crater or other low point in the terrain and the water will drop the material it is transporting. This material can build up in large fan-shaped mounds at the end of the channel.<br><br>In this observation, this is likely what has happened. The fan-shaped mound (which appears bluish in this false-color image) sits at the end of a short channel. Analysis of spectroscopic data shows that the composition of this material indicates a history of interaction with liquid water. The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_014100_014199/ESP_014159_1670/ESP_014159_1670_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>full resolution version</strong></a> of this HiRISE image shows layering that indicates this material was dumped here in at least three separate episodes.<br><br>Although they may once have been common, features like this are now rare. Scientists study them to try and understand how much liquid water affected the composition and appearance of Mars in its early history.<br>

ESP_014260_1675	ìWrinkle ridgesî are topographic structures produced by subsurface faulting; they are commonly found on both the Moon and Mars.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_014200_014299/ESP_014260_1675/ESP_014260_1675_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>This image shows a site</strong></a> where a wrinkle ridge intersects a crater; the ridge is a large feature and extends well outside this observation. The spur just inside the crater rim is roughly in line with the wrinkle ridge structure, and probably represents enhanced crater collapse along the fault line.<br><br>An alternative possibility is that this spur was created by movement of the wrinkle ridge fault after the crater formed, but this is unlikely because the outer rim of the crater is not cut. Observations like this help constrain the relative timing of events on Mars.<br>
ESP_014261_0930	This HiRISE image is of a portion of Mars' south polar residual ice cap. Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles.<br><br>Because Mars is so much colder, however, the seasonal ice that gets deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring (generally analogous to winter-time snow on Earth) is actually carbon dioxide ice. Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter. This persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south polar residual cap, and is what we are looking at in this HiRISE image.<br><br>Relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by semi-circular depressions and linear, branching troughs that make a pattern resembling those of your fingerprints. The high-standing areas are thicknesses of several meters of carbon dioxide ice. The depressions and troughs are thought to be caused by the removal of carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). HiRISE is observing this carbon dioxide terrain to try to determine how these patterns develop and how fast the depressions and troughs grow.<br><br>While the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly changes taking place within it. With the high resolution of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over multiple Mars years. Knowing the amount of carbon dioxide removed can give us an idea of the atmospheric, weather, and climate conditions over the course of a year.<br><br>In addition, looking for where carbon dioxide ice might be being deposited on top of this terrain may help us understand if there is any net loss or accumulation of the carbon-dioxide ice over time, which would be a good indicator of whether Mars' climate is in the process of changing or not.<br>
ESP_014272_1245	Though a variety of origins have been proposed, this sinuous, layered, boulder-filled deposit in the southern Argyre Planitia is likely an esker. Eskers form in wet-based glaciers, when water flows inside or below the glaciers and deposits sediment. After the ice melts, the sediment is left behind as a ridge.<br><br>Because the material is deposited by flowing water, the sediment in eskers is sorted: larger rocks, pebbles, sand grains, etc. are deposited first, and smaller sediment, such as smaller pebbles, sand, or clay, are deposited further from the source and on top of the coarser material. Several factorsóincluding the amount of sediment available, the speed and volume of the flowing water, and the slope over which it flowedódetermine how much sediment is deposited and how large the dominant grain size is. There may be many of these sequences preserved within an esker.<br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014272_1245_cut.jpg'><strong>Eskers look a little like</strong></a> inverted river beds. One relatively simple way to differentiate between the two is that inverted river beds record flow in a downhill direction along their entire length. Eskers, on the other hand, can record flow both down- and uphill. This is possible because water flowing through the ice tunnels in glaciers is under pressure, just like water in a hose.<br><br>This particular esker is part of a branching and braided network of ridges in the southern Argyre basin. The boulders are on the order of 1-3 meters (about 3-10 feet) in diameter.<br>
ESP_014324_0955	The south polar layered deposits are a stack of ice and dust about 3 kilometers (2 miles) thick. The many layers that make up this feature are of great interest to planetary scientists because, just as with ice sheets on Earth, they are thought to contain a record of the planetís climate in previous times.<br><br>As with the rest of Mars, impact craters form continuously on these polar deposits. Rarely, a very large impact will occur and the crater will excavate all the way through this ice-sheet to the rocky terrain underneath. This is what happened in the case of McMurdo, a crater roughly 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) across which punched through the ice-sheet in the past.<br><br>This HiRISE image shows the wall of this crater, only half of which has been preserved until current times. You can see the many layers that comprise the south polar layered deposits exposed here. Scientists study exposures like this to try to understand the length of the climatic record that is recorded in the icy material at the poles of Mars.<br>
ESP_014351_1995	This image covers the eastern half of the 20.5 kilometer diameter Santa Fe impact crater. This moderately sized crater possesses a fluid-like ejecta blanket, which is typically referred to as ìlayered ejecta.î<br><br>The term layered ejecta is used because it is less suggestive then ìfluidized,î which suggests that water is involved. There is an ongoing debate as to whether this type of ejecta is formed from  ices or fluids in the target, may be a consequence of interactions between the ejecta and the atmosphere,or both. <br><br>Sante Fe Crater is located about 150 km south of the Viking Lander 1 site in Chryse Planitia. Because this is a well-preserved impact crater, the high-resolution image here captures several important aspects of larger impact craters in general and large layered ejecta type craters in particular.<br><br>The crater is covered in this image from its central peak on the west edge of the image to almost the crater rim on the east side, and north and south onto the ejecta surface beyond the crater rim. The margins of the ejecta that are  characteristic of this type of crater are not visible in this observation, but have been imaged by HiRISE (<a href='ESP_012795_1995'><strong>ESP_012795_1995</strong></a>). Parallel ridges of outcrop on the inner slopes of the north and south crater wall are ìterracesî of faulted wall rock common to large complex impact craters.<br><br>In the north and south quarter of the image, the surface of the ejecta beyond the crater  is visible as a rolling and hilly terrain. Throughout the image, and particularly along the base of slopes and scarps there are numerous small ridges. These are dunes, much younger than- and unrelated to  the formation of the crater.<br><br>Santa Fe Crater takes its name from Santa Fe, New Mexico. (The convention for naming craters on Mars states that some craters may be named after towns with populations smaller than 100,000.) During the Viking Landing site selection in 1976, early Viking Orbiter images were acquired of southern Chrsye Planitia near the outflow point of Kasei Vallis onto the Chryse plains. In honor of the 200th anniversary of the nation at that time, local craters near the landing site were named after towns important in the Nationís founding. Santa Fe, was one of the first towns on the continent, so one of the craters was named after the town.<br> <br>Interestingly, the town of Santa Fe, New Mexico lies just 40 km east of another young 20 km-diameter crater, except this one is not an impact crater, but rather a giant volcanic caldera, the Vallis Caldera. <br>
ESP_014353_1685	CRISM observations of this region of the Noctis Labyrinthus formation have shown indications of iron-bearing sulfates and phyllosilicate (clay) minerals.<br><br>HiRISE observations have revealed exposed layers which are possibly the sources of the signatures seen by CRISM. <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014353_1685_cut.jpg'><strong>In the subimage</strong>,</a> the layering can be seen in the lower part of the image.

ESP_014393_2485	As the Phoenix lander started to get a glimpse of the Sun towards the end of the northern hemisphere winter, HiRISE decided to try imaging the site despite the low light levels. The power of the HiRISE camera helped us see it even under these poor conditions.<br><br>By matching up the images <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/frost-free.jpg'><strong>with the known location</strong></a> of the lander, <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/july-august-09.jpg'><strong>we can identify the hardware, even disguised by frost and poor lighting.</strong></a> To make things worse, some of these images are also low-quality due to atmospheric haze, which often obscures the surface at this location and season.  <br><br>In this image, the albedo (brightness) doesn't necessarily indicate the amount of frost. Keep in mind that each of these images is stretched differently for optimal contrast, so "bright" and "dark" can't be compared directly between images without doing complex calibrations. In fact, if you stretched all of them exactly the same, the darker areas in the frost-covered ESP images are still brighter than typical soil, like that surrounding the lander in the frost-free <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008855_2485'><strong>PSP_008855_2485</strong></a> image. <br><br>In addition, other factors affect the relative brightness, such as the size of individual grains of carbon dioxide ice, the amount of dust mixed in with the ice, the amount of sunlight hitting the surface, and different lighting angles and slopes. The winds are also changing direction and strength, moving loose frost and dust around over time. Studying these changes will help us understand the nature of the seasonal frost and winter weather patterns in this area of Mars.<br><br>The amount of carbon dioxide frost is increasing as late winter transitions to early spring, so the layer of frost is getting thicker in each image, slowly encasing the lander. The maximum thickness was expected to be on the order of tens of centimeters, which would have reached its peak in September 2009.<br><br>Unfortunately, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was in the midst of an extended safe mode following a spacecraft anomaly, so HiRISE was unable to capture an image at that time. <br><br>The Planetary Society <a href='http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00002182/'><strong>has put together an animation</strong></a> comparing the hardware at different times.<br><br><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>Information about the images:<br><br><a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008855_2485'><strong>PSP_008855_2485</strong></a> - 16 June 2008 - Ls 86 (northern hemisphere summer) - incidence angle 51.2 degrees - during active mission (frost-free, for comparison)<br><br><a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014103_2485'><strong>ESP_014103_2485</strong></a> - 30 July 2009 - Ls 313 (northern hemisphere winter) - incidence angle 89.2 degrees<br><br>
ESP_014394_2045	A boulder track is visible in the <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014394_2045_cut.jpg'><strong>center of this subimage</strong></a>. <br><br>The track formed on the sloping wall of an impact crater when a rock bounced or rolled downhill leaving behind marks on the surface. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_014300_014399/ESP_014394_2045/ESP_014394_2045_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>In the full image,</strong></a> you can see its whole path, starting from a cliff to the east, from which it presumably originated. The boulder itself is visible as a brighter rock in the middle of the dark slope streak, where it finally came to a halt.  <br><br>Slope streaks begin at a point, and it only takes a small disturbance at that point to initiate the streak, such as <a href='PSP_009192_1890'>a dust devil</a> or <a href='PSP_003259_1850'>an impact crater</a>. We have <a href='PSP_002396_1900'>seen these streaks appear</a>, so this is an ongoing process on Mars. The streaks tend to start out dark and fade as they get older; we have even seen some that are <a href='PSP_007653_2010'>lighter in color than their surroundings</a>. Scientists think these are caused by dry avalanches of dust or sand falling downhill, revealing darker material underneath. The streaks are very shallow and don't appear to disturb pre-existing features on the surface, like ripples, or in this case, the boulder tracks. This case is particularly interesting because the slope streak appears to have flowed around the boulder, leaving a patch of brighter material undisturbed in the lee of the rock. From this relationship, you can tell that the boulder must have fallen before the slope streak formed.<br><br>For scale, the boulder is about 6 meters (approximately 20 feet) across, and the dark streak is about 125 meters (approximately 400 feet) wide at its widest point.<br><br>Thanks to the sharp-eyed HiRISE fan Daniel who brought this image to our attention!<br>
ESP_014404_1765	Barchan dunes are common on both Earth and Mars. These dunes are very distinctive in shape, and are important because they can tell scientists about the environment in which they formed.<br><br>Barchans form in wind regimes that blow in one dominant direction. The ridged arcs of sand that define the barchan dunes end in horns that point downwind. Sand is transported up the broad, relatively shallow windward slopes and once it overtops the dune crest, the sand falls down a shorter steeper slope between the horns, known as the slip face.  <a href='/images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014404_1765_cut.jpg'><strong>Over time, the barchans migrate downwind, following their horns.</strong></a> (The subimage refers to the non-map projected version of the image.)<br><br>This HiRISE image shows an example of several barchans merging to form an even larger barchan dune. This can happen through a variety of circumstances, such as when smaller, faster dunes collide with larger, slower-moving dunes that absorb them, resulting in single, larger dunes.  The distance between the merging horns of the large dune in this highlighted region is a little over 500 meters (about 1600 feet).<br>
ESP_014413_0930	Marsí carbon dioxide atmosphere partially condenses every winter to form polar caps of dry ice. In the spring, the evaporation of the ice is a dynamic process and carves channels into the ground as it escapes back into the atmosphere.<br><br>Often these channels are radial in nature, and are colloquially refered to as ìspiders,î although the prefered term for these radially-organized channels is ìaraneiformî which means spider-like.  <br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014413_0930_cut.jpg'><strong>In this subimage</strong></a> all the seasonal frost is gone, and we can use stereo images or shadow measurements to measure the depth of the channels carved into the ground, typically 1 - 2 meters deep.
ESP_014417_1975	Impact craters on Mars are kind of neat: many of them look very different than impact craters seen on the Moon or Mercury.<br><br>Fresh lunar and Mercurian craters have ejecta blankets that look a bit rough near the crater rims; around larger craters, long rays or chains of secondary craters radiate away from the crater rims. Some Martian craters are similar to these craters, but Mars also has a high proportion of craters with forms not found on the Moon or Mercury: rampart craters.<br><br>Rampart craters, also called fluidized-ejecta craters, have ejecta blankets that appear lobate, or rounded, and end in low ridges or ramparts, such as the ridge in this HiRISE image. Here you see the rampart at the edge of the ejecta blanket that comes from an approximately 16 kilometer (10 mile)-diameter crater, about 16 km (10 mi) to the east. <br><br>For years there has been a debate about whether these lobes and ramparts were formed by ejecta interacting with the thin Martian atmosphere, or whether they formed because volatiles (such as water or ice) in the subsurface were incorporated into the ejecta material excavated by the impact. The common consensus is now in favor of the volatile hypothesis. Because of this, rampart craters can be used to indicate the past presence of water or ice in the Martian crust.<br>
ESP_014423_1040	Somewhere in this patterned landscape less than 1,000 kilometers (about 600 miles) from the south pole of Mars, a treasure may be hiding.<br><br>In January 1999, NASA launched a rocket containing the <a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/'><strong>Mars Polar Lander</strong></a> (MPL), an exploration vehicle with a weather station and a subsurface probe designed to search for water ice, towards the layered terrain near the Martian south pole. The layers are thought to be a sequence of alternating dust-rich and dust-poor ice deposited by the seasonal advance and retreat of the south polar ice cap and could be an important record of climate on the Red Planet.<br><br>On 3 December 1999, just before the lander entered the Martian atmosphere, MPL went silent. Investigations propose the most likely cause of the mission failure is that the spacecraftís computers misinterpreted the release of the landerís legs in preparation for descent as touch-down on the Martian surface, causing descent engines to shut off when the lander was still 40 meters (130 feet) above ground. However, no one knows for sure.<br><br>An immediate search began for the remains of the MPL using images from Mars Global Surveyor. HiRISE is continuing the search with high resolution images of the area in which MPL is most likely to have landed. <br>
ESP_014436_0920	A thick (approximately 3 kilometer or about 2 mile) sequence of ice and dust, stacked like a layer cake, covers the south pole of Mars. Impact craters that form here experience slightly different processes of modification and degradation than those that form in rocky areas.<br><br>One example of such a process is sublimation. Most of the material that makes up an icy crater is volatile, meaning it can melt or sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas) if heated. Sublimation is more common on Mars because of its thin, dry atmosphere. Crater walls facing the Sun receive more direct light than their surroundings, and are therefore more easily warmed. If the ice in the walls sublimates, the rim structure of the crater becomes degraded.<br><br>The impact crater in this image is roughly 900 meters (a little over 0.5 mile) across. The remaining raised rim of the crater is illuminated from the bottom right of the image, causing preferential heating of the interior of the rim structure. The ice appears thin here (more brown material is exposed), with an even thinner cover on the remaining exterior rim. This could be caused by a number of possibilities: perhaps the exterior wall is steeper than the interior wall, resulting in more direct exposure to sunlight, causing more efficient sublimation when the Sun shines on that wall.<br><br>Once ice begins to melt, darker dustier material is exposed. The darker material absorbs more heat than white ice (just like standing in the Sun wearing a black shirt makes you warmer than wearing a white shirt, which reflects the Sun's light), causing more and more ice to sublimate near the dark material. You can observe this process happening around the exterior crater wall <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_014436_0920_cut.jpg'><strong>in this HiRISE image.</strong></a><br><br>
ESP_015942_1980	This image lies in the middle of a candidate landing site in the Northeast part of Syrtis Major, a huge shield volcano, and near the Northwest rim of Isidis Planitia, a giant impact basin.<br><br>This region exposes Early Noachian bedrock, more than 4 billion years old, and contains a diversity of hydrated minerals. This would be an excellent place to explore early Mars, when the environment may have been conducive to life.<br><br>HiRISE images will help determine if this spot is sufficiently safe for landing--not too many boulders or steep slopes. If it is safe, it may be considered for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory or the 2018 rovers from Europe and the United States.<br><br>
ESP_015962_1695	This image shows a very fresh-looking impact crater with <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_015962_1695_cut1.jpg'><strong>extensive radial ejecta</strong></a>.<br><br>The crater was first seen in an image acquired with MRO's <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/'><strong>Context Camera (CTX).</strong></a> The best image of this region prior to CTX was from one of the Viking Orbiters, and the crater isn't apparent in that image. This could mean that the crater formed sometime between 1976 and 1999, or there may have been more dust on the surface in 1976 or the air may have been hazy, obscuring the crater.<br><br>Based on the HiRISE image, we suspect that the crater is more than several decades old, because at <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_015962_1695_cut2.jpg'><strong>full resolution</strong></a> we see a textured surface that is common in dust-mantled regions of Mars, but absent in the youngest craters.<br>

A common technique for estimating the age of a given surface involves counting how many craters of each size are present on that surface.  This will help us better understand results from that technique, and refine it to give more accurate ages.  <br><br>Small impacts like these also represent a hazard to future exploration, both on Mars and the Moon. Imagine if one of the Martian rovers had been at this spot when this object blasted into the surface! This may be a very small crater on planetary scales, but it could still cause a lot of damage. On the Moon, where there is no atmosphere to provide protection from even the tiniest micrometeorite, the danger would be even higher.

ESP_016032_2600	In the winter a layer of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) covers the north polar sand dunes. In the spring the sublimation of the ice (going directly from ice to gas) causes a host of uniquely Martian phenomena.<br><br><a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016032_2600_cut.jpg'><strong>In this subimage</strong></a> streaks of dark basaltic sand have been carried from below the ice layer to form fan-shaped deposits on top of the seasonal ice. The similarity in the directions of the fans suggests that they formed at the same time, when the wind direction and speed was the same. They often form along the boundary between the dune and the surface below the dunes.<br>
ESP_016036_1370	Dunes of sand-sized materials have been trapped on the floors of many Martian craters. This is one example, from a crater in Noachis Terra, west of the giant Hellas impact basin.<br><br>The dunes here are linear, thought to be due to shifting wind directions. <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_016036_1370_cut.jpg'><strong>In places,</strong></a> each dune is remarkably similar to adjacent dunes, including a reddish (or dust colored) band on northeast-facing slopes.

Titan has a very different environment and composition, so at meter-scale resolution they probably are very different from Martian dunes.<br>
ESP_016087_2595	Dunes are often found on crater floors. In the winter time at high northern latitudes the terrain is covered by carbon dioxide ice (dry ice). In the spring as this seasonal ice evaporates many unusual features unique to Mars are visible.<br><br>On the floor of this crater where there are no dunes, the ice forms an uninterrupted layer. On the dunes however, dark streaks form as surface material from below the ice is mobilized and deposited on top of the ice.

ESP_016160_2485	With early spring at the Phoenix landing site comes the progressive sublimation of the carbon dioxide frost that has blanketed the lander and surrounding terrain throughout the winter.<br><br>During the long polar-winter night atmospheric carbon dioxide freezes onto the surface building up a layer of frost roughly 30 centimeters (about one foot) thick. In the spring this frost returns to atmosphere gas (sublimates) over the course of several months.

However, extensive frost patches remain in the topographic lows, such as the troughs of the local polygonally patterned surface.<br><br>The solar arrays on the lander were clearly discernable from their distinctive bluish color in HiRISE images acquired last Martian northern summer. <a href='images/2009/details/cut/ESP_016160_2485_cut.jpg'><strong>The enhanced color subimage</strong></a> has green boxes around the backshell (top), heat shield, and lander (bottom).

ESP_016173_2005	Although there are a few truly giant shield volcanoes on Mars, there are also many smaller shield volcanoes. We are interested in imaging the vent regions of volcanoes to understand volcanic processes, and also to search for any signs of especially recent activity.<br><br>It has been suggested that active volcanism is one possible explanation for the methane gas that has been detected in the atmosphere of Mars. This HiRISE image shows that the summit caldera is mantled by dust and covered by small impact craters, so there is essentially zero chance that this volcano was active recently enough to affect current atmospheric trace gases.<br><br>
ESP_016173_2640	This HiRISE image shows several isolated clouds of particles near a steep cliff in the northern polar region of Mars.<br><br>These clouds, rolling or hovering close to the ground yet reaching up tens of meters high (up to 180 ft.), are likely the result of an avalanche or fall of mostly carbon-dioxide frost. The frost clings to the scarp in the darkness of winter and may be disrupted by sunlight and thermal processes with the coming of spring. The cliff, approximately 700 meters (2000 feet) high is made up of layers of water ice with varying dust content, roughly similar to the polar ice caps on Earth.<br><br>On top is bright white carbon-dioxide ice and frost. Last year, HiRISE was monitoring this area for changes in frost patterns as spring progressed - it was quite surprising and very exciting to find an avalanche in progress (e.g. <a href='PSP_007338_2640'><strong>PSP_007338_2640</strong></a>)! This year, we were ready to capture more. Targeting this scarp as well as others around the edge of the north polar icy layered deposits will help determine if this process is a characteristic one in Mars' cycle of seasons, including the period of year it is active and how wide-spread around the region it is. Several such events occurred later this year at this same scarp (e.g. <a href='ESP_016423_2640'><strong>ESP_016423_1640</strong></a>), and several more were also seen at a few other scarps (e.g. <a href='ESP_016228_2650'><strong>ESP_016228_2650</strong></a>) spread around about one-third of the circumference of the polar region.<br><br>Looking at all of the individual instances of avalanches from all of the images will also allow us to piece together a sequence of snaphots of the whole avalanche process, from beginning (a stream of material falling down the cliff face) to end (lingering puffy clouds). Based on this year's observations, these events happen mostly in the middle of spring, roughly equivalent to April to early May on Earth. And, they are indeed more widespread than just this one scarp. All together, it seems this is a regular spring process at Mars' north pole that may be expected every year - avalanche season! This information, in conjunction with the results of numerical modeling of the behavior of the materials involved, will help us find out what is causing these dramatic events.<br>
ESP_016216_1900	This image shows part of Cerberus Fossae, a long system of extensional (normal) faults arranged in trough-bounding (graben-bounding) pairs. Cerberus Fossae served as the source of a large volcanic eruption that draped Athabasca Valles in lava.<br><br>Large boulders that have been dislodged from the graben walls are visible on the floor of Cerberus Fossae. <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016216_1900_cut1.jpg'><strong>The first subimage shows an example</strong></a> of an approximately 6 meter (20 feet) boulder that left a distinct track as it moved downhill. Although this track is quite clear, ripples inside the track are discernable, indicating that enough time has passed for wind activity to rework loose material into the form of ripples. With close examination of this observation, one can see many boulder tracks, some with ripples and some without ripples.  <br><br>Wind streaks emanating from impact craters are visible on the plains surrounding Cerberus Fossae. <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016216_1900_cut2.jpg'><strong>The second subimage shows</strong></a> a false color image of an approximately 33 meters (108 feet) impact crater. Material on the crater floor (blue in the color image) is being moved by the wind out of the crater and across the plains. The wind streaks in this observation indicate that the predominant wind direction in this region is from East to West.<br>
ESP_016219_1980	This image lies on the eastern edge of a candidate landing site in the northeastern part of Syrtis Major, a huge shield volcano, and near the northwestern rim of Isidis Planitia, a giant impact basin.<br><br>This region exposes <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noachian_epoch#Noachian_epoch'><strong>Early Noachian</strong></a> bedrock, more than 4 billion years old, and contains a diversity of hydrated minerals. This would be an excellent place to explore early Mars, when the environment may have been conducive to life.<br><br>HiRISE images will aid geologic interpretations and help determine if this spot is sufficiently safe for landing--not too many boulders or steep slopes. If it is sufficiently safe, it may be considered for the 2011 <a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> or the 2018 rovers from Europe and the USA. <br>
ESP_016288_1745	This image covers part of a candidate landing site that appears to be a shallow depression with a deposit perhaps consisting of chlorides, like table salt.<br><br>The relatively bright material broken up into polygons or other patterns is possibly chloride. Such deposits occur in playas on Earth, and imply the past presence of water and a habitable (but not necessarily inhabited) environment. The HiRISE images will help to interpret the geology and to determine if this spot is a sufficiently safe landing site&mdash;not too many boulders or steep slopes.  If it is safe enough, this site will be considered further as a landing site for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory or for a European or NASA rover to be launched in 2018 according to current plans.  <br><br>Be sure also to look at the <a href='anaglyph/singula.php?ID=ESP_016288_1745'><strong>stereo anaglyph</strong></a> for more detail.<br>
ESP_016292_2640	This HiRISE image shows the scarp that demarcates the boundary between layered deposits covering the north polar region and the lower surrounding terrain, which includes sand dunes.<br><br>This image was taken in the northern hemisphere Martian spring, where it is still cold enough that white carbon dioxide frost covers most of the area. At about the same time in the previous Martian spring (February 2008), HiRISE <a href='http://uahirise.org/PSP_007338_2640'><strong>caught four avalanches</strong></a> at this location.<br><br>This image does not show any active avalanches, but <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016292_2640_cut.jpg'><strong>shows many avalanche deposits.</strong></a> Comparison of this new image with the one taken in 2008 will give an indication of activity over the last Martian year.<br>
ESP_016306_2410	Sometimes HiRISE finds something unexpected.<br><br>This image was targeted to study knobs in Mars' northern plains, just north of Scandia Crater. The knobs are clearly imaged, but what surprised  scientists was a dust devil visible <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016306_2410_cut.jpg'><strong>in the south-central part of the image.</strong></a><br><br>As on Earth, dust devils form when ground heated by sunlight warms the air above it. The hot air rises, forming an updraft accompanied by vortical motions. Because warm ground is a requirement, dust devils on Mars generally form in late spring to summer, especially at high latitudes.<br><br>This image was taken in early spring (2010), at a latitude of 61 degrees North. No dust devil has been seen this far from the equator at such an early season before.  <br>
ESP_016354_1745	There is an intriguing surface unit in parts of the ancient Martian highlands that may consist of chloride salts (like NaCl--table salt) which precipitated out of shallow lakes as in desert regions of Earth.<br><br>It has unusual thermal properties and distinctive morphologies, but lacks spectral absorption bands. All of these characteristics and the geologic settings are consistent with salt deposits. These deposits are often associated with clay minerals that do have distinctive absorption bands. <br><br>This particular location has been selected as a candidate landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory or another future rover. Hopefully the HiRISE images won't reveal too many boulders or steep slopes that would be hazardous. A stereo anaglyph is also available.<br>
ESP_016423_2640	This HiRISE image shows at least three <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016423_2640_cut.jpg'><strong>isolated clouds</strong></a> of particles near a steep cliff in the northern polar region of Mars.<br><br>These clouds, rolling or hovering close to the ground yet reaching up tens of meters high (up to 180 feet), are likely the result of an avalanche or fall of mostly carbon-dioxide frost. The frost clings to the scarp in the darkness of winter and may be disrupted by sunlight and thermal processes with the coming of spring. The cliff, approximately 700 meters (2000 feet) high is made up of layers of water ice with varying dust content, roughly similar to the polar ice caps on Earth.<br><br>On top is bright white carbon-dioxide ice and frost. Last year, HiRISE was monitoring this area for changes in frost patterns as spring progressed - it was quite surprising and very exciting to find an avalanche in progress (e.g. <a href='PSP_007338_2640'><strong>PSP_007338_2640</strong></a>)! This year, we were ready to capture more.<br><br>Targeting this scarp as well as others around the edge of the north polar icy layered deposits will help determine if this process is a characteristic one in Mars' cycle of seasons, including the period of year it is active and how wide-spread around the region it is. Several such events occurred earlier this year at this same scarp (e.g. <a href='ESP_016173_2640'><strong>ESP_016173_2640</strong></a>), and several more were also seen at a few other scarps (e.g. <a href='ESP_016228_2650'><strong>ESP_016228_2650</strong></a>) spread around about one-third of the circumference of the polar region.<br><br>Looking at all of the individual instances of avalanches from all of the images will also allow us to piece together a sequence of snaphots of the whole avalanche process, from beginning (a stream of material falling down the cliff face) to end (lingering puffy clouds). Based on this year's observations, these events happen mostly in the middle of spring, roughly equivalent to April to early May on Earth. And, they are indeed more widespread than just this one scarp. All together, it seems this is a regular spring process at Mars' north pole that may be expected every year - avalanche season! This information, in conjunction with the results of numerical modeling of the behavior of the materials involved, will help us find out what is causing these dramatic events.<br>
ESP_016459_1830	This image shows dark sand dunes and inverted craters in the Arabia Terra region of Mars.<br><br>The sand is dark because it was probably derived from basalt, a black volcanic rock that is common on Mars. Unlike traditional craters that are depressions, those here stick up above the surrounding plains. Such "inverted topography" is found on Mars and Earth where erosion has stripped away surrounding topography. <br><br>In this case, the craters were filled with sediment.  Subsequent erosion stripped away the terrain around the filled craters, leaving the inverted topography visible here. <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016459_1830_cut.jpg'><strong>The enlarged color view shows</strong></a> one of the inverted craters surrounded by the dark dunes.<br>
ESP_016538_2190	This observation (forming a stereo pair with <a href='ESP_017171_2190'><strong>ESP_017171_2190</strong></a>) shows part of an unnamed crater whose fill material has collapsed.<br><br>This crater may have been filled with ice, then covered by sediments or lava. Later the ice was lost by melting or sublimation and the topmost layer of indurated material collapsed, forming the broken and bent layer seen today.  <br><br>The original image description reads "Pristine channels in fractured materials on crater floor." That's because when the target suggestion was entered (by me), I thought there were some narrow dark curving channels from a quick examination of MOC image R1601469. This could indicate geologically-recent flow of water, the stuff we're supposed to follow.<br><br>However, the HiRISE images, especially viewed in stereo, show that these narrow dark features are actually the steep edges of escarpments created by the collapse. So beware of believing HiRISE image descriptions! Sometimes our initial impressions collapse.<br>
ESP_016563_1385	The western margin of Alpheus Colles (the large plateau in Hellas Planitia) is bound by a large depression that is the deepest point in the Hellas basin and also the lowest terrain on Mars.<br><br>This region is characterized by highly deformed layered sediment nicknamed "honeycomb" or "taffy pull" terrain. The origin of this unusual layered sediment is unknown, but it may be related to an ancient lake or ocean in Hellas.<br>
ESP_016641_2500	From a distance, the floor of this crater looks like a giant honeycomb or spider web. The intersecting shapes, or polygons, commonly occur in the northern lowlands of Mars.<br><br>The polygons in this "patterned ground" are easy to see because their edges are bound by troughs or ridges covered by bright frost relative to their darker, frost-free interiors. Patterned ground on Mars is thought to form as the result of cyclic thermal contraction cracking in the permanently frozen ground.<br><br>Scientists study polygonally-patterned ground on Mars because the occurrence and physical characteristics of the polygons helps us understand the recent and past distribution of ice (frozen water) in the shallow subsurface. These features also provide clues about climate conditions. <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016641_2500_cut.jpg'><strong>The subimage shows</strong></a> smaller polygons within larger polygons.<br>
ESP_016644_1780	This image shows the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016644_1780_cut.jpg'><strong>perched on the edge of ConcepciÛn Crater</strong></a> in Meridiani Planum, Mars.<br><br>ConcepciÛn Crater is a fresh, 10 meter-diameter crater with dark rays that clearly overprint the north trending aeolian ripples. The dark rays are produced by shadows cast by blocky ejecta and the presence of the rays and similar relationships with other fresh craters in Meridiani Planum indicate that this is likely the youngest crater visited by either rover on Mars (estimated to have impacted thousands to tens of thousands of years ago).<br><br>This image was acquired by HiRISE on 13 February 2010, on sol 2153 of Opportunityís mission on Mars. Note the rover tracks in the ripples to the north and northwest of the rover.  Scientists use these high-resolution images (about 25 cm/pixel) to help navigate the rover. In addition, rover exploration of areas covered by such high-resolution images provides ìground truthî for the orbital data.<br>
ESP_016677_1650	This observation covers the Columbia Hills and the surrounding plains of Gusev Crater, which the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit has been exploring since January 2004. Repeat images of this site have been acquired to study aeolian (wind-related) changes on the surface.<br><br>This image was acquired in February 2010, six months after the most recent prior image (<a href='ESP_014277_1650'><strong>ESP_014277_1650</strong></a>) and seven months after the most recent color image (<a href='ESP_013921_1650'><strong>ESP_013921_1650</strong></a>) of Spirit's location. During the intervening time, a significant regional dust storm blanketed Gusev crater, and bright Martian dust subsequently settled onto the surface. The surface around the Columbia Hills therefore appears brighter in this new image. However, numerous dark streaks are superposed on this surface; these are probably tracks left by dust devils migrating across the Gusev plains.<br><br>While driving around the "Home Plate" feature in the Columbia Hills, Spirit's wheels have excavated bright soils that were previously buried several centimeters beneath the Martian surface. These soils contain minerals such as sulfates and opaline silica that suggest past water activity at this location. The excavated soils are visible from orbit in previous HiRISE color images, where they appear as small, bright, blue-toned patches. These patches are all virtually invisible in the new HiRISE image, suggesting that the soils may have been buried by dust settling during the past few months.<br><br>Combining these orbital images with those taken by Spirit on the Martian surface provides a view of aeolian surface changes at a range of scales.<br>
ESP_016700_2075	This image of a wind streak monitoring site northwest of Uranius Tholus shows dramatic differences from earlier images and evidence for two distinct processes of Martian wind erosion. Located near the northern end of the Tharsis rise at a moderate elevation (1800 m above datum), the site is in a region of high albedo and low thermal inertia that suggest a thick mantle of dust. Cutout 1 shows some of the changes that have occurred since the site was last imaged in January, 2009 (ESP_011465_2075). Bright dust has been scoured from the surface by strong southerly winds (blowing from the top right in these unprojected images). Bright streaks trail downwind from impact craters, protected from the wind in the lee of the crater rims. Sharp dark streaks edged upwind as the dust was stripped away. At least two different episodes of erosion with slightly different wind directions can be inferred from the orientations of the dark streaks. Yet another wind direction is indicated by the few dune-like ripples that can be seen in the floor of the valley. These features were shaped by much older winds that were probably controlled by local topography. <br><br><br>Cutout 2 shows the second erosion process, the tracks of dust-devils across the newly cleaned surface (just south of cutout 1). What makes these tracks interesting is that they are bright! Most dust-devil tracks on Mars are dark, forming when a whirlwind lifts bright dust off the surface and exposes a darker substrate. These tracks were not visible in the HiRISE image taken 13 months ago, nor in an earlier image (PSP_002222_2075) acquired in January, 2007. The cause of the bright tracks is unclear. Bright dust-devil tracks were also spotted by the Mars Orbital Camera in southern Schiaparelli crater, a region also dominated at the time by wind streaks. One way to make bright tracks would be to excavate through dark material (such as a lag of basaltic sand) to a brighter substrate. Another possibility is that the dust-devils stir up the remaining pockets of bright dust that are hiding from the prevailing winds in the shelter of topographic obstacles.<br>
ESP_016731_2360	Common to the northern plains of Mars are rock and boulder strewn landscapes otherwise devoid of major features, short of a few impact craters. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/ESP/ORB_016700_016799/ESP_016731_2360/ESP_016731_2360_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>This image in the Cydnus Rupes region</strong></a> of northern Utopia Planitia is an excellent example of this sort of terrain.<br><br>Boulders up to several meters in size densely coat the landscape. The concentration of these boulders varies at several scales. In some areas only smaller rocks less than a meter across dominate the surface, while a couple hundred meters away may be a somewhat circular "blotch" of larger boulders. Often these blotches of boulders coincide <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016731_2360_cut.jpg'><strong>with a faint circular ridge</strong></a>, the remnant of an impact crater now reduced by erosion and infilling to a a mere hint of a crater rim. The abundant boulders excavated by the impact, however, remain scattered over the surface to mark the past event. <br><br>Close examination of excavated large rocks and boulders may yield clues to the geologic processes that have shaped the regional landscape over Martian history. However, as a future landing site, these terrains are perilous. Large boulders can damage landing gear and puncture the underside of spacecraft. Rovers would find it extremely difficult to traverse through dense populations of large rocks and boulders.  <br>
ESP_016807_2060	This image shows a new impact crater that formed on Mars between May 2002 and February 2004. It was discovered in data from the Mars Odyssey Mission THEMIS instrument and later confirmed to be an impact crater by the Context Camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. HiRISE is monitoring this site, at latitude 25.5 degrees and East longitude 221.8 degrees, to watch for changes brought about by the Martian winds.<br><br>Comparison of this image with an earlier HiRISE image (<a href='PSP_004175_2060'><strong>PSP_004175_2060</strong></a>) taken more than a Martian year earlier <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016807_2060_cut.jpg'><strong>shows significant changes.</strong></a> The dark ejecta from the impact has faded considerably in the interval between June 2007 and February 2010. The fading is probably more significant than represented by these images, since the phase angle (the angle between the Sun, the surface, and the spacecraft) was much larger in the earlier image (72.2 degrees) than in the more recent picture (33.2 degrees). Images taken at higher phase angle tend to emphasize topography and make color and brightness differences less prominent. <br><br>The timing of the fading in not known, but the changes could have coincided with a global dust storm that took place in July 2007, shortly after the earlier image was acquired.<br>

Most of the rocks in this area appear to have formed originally as laterally continuous layers through volcanic or sedimentary processes. Loss of groundwater or ground ice could have then caused the ground to collapse, forming the network of deep valleys and isolated hills we see today. Subtle layering of these rocks can be observed along many slope faces jutting out from under a mantle of surface sediments.<br><br>Also present along many slopes are dark-toned, discontinuous lineations.

The margin of Olympus Mons is defined by a massive, tall cliff. At this location, it is nearly 7 kilometers (23,000 ft) tall. The cliff exposes the guts of the volcano, revealing interbedded hard and soft layers. The hard layers are lava and the soft layers may be dust (from large dust storms) or volcanic ash.<br><br>This HiRISE image also shows a large tongue of material that has flowed over the giant cliff.  While superficially similar to lava flows, this flow is actually a landslide. Most scientists think the the cliffs also formed by landslides, just much bigger ones. All this collapse is driven by the weight of the huge volcano exceeding the strength of the rocks of which it is composed.  <br>

What formed this hill? Could it be a volcano?  That was hypothesized to be the case in a paper published in 2001, and this suggestion was entered to test that idea, perhaps from seeing internal layering exposed by the crater.<br><br>This is an example of what we regard as an excellent science justification&mdash;following up on a testable hypothesis with specific observational goals. It was entered by blogospherian Emily Lakdawalla of the Planetary Society. If you're thinking we chose to acquire this image early because we want her to blog nice things about HiRISE and HiWiSH, you're right! But its also a good suggestion.<br><br>So what does the HiRISE image show us? Mostly it shows a dust mantle, hiding the bedrock it was intended to study. The dustiness is especially apparent from the uniformity of the color data. Much of Mars is covered by dust, so we often favor the relatively dust-free patches for HiRISE imaging. (You can usually tell whether a surface is dusty by looking at <a href='http://www.mars.asu.edu/data/'><strong>dust index maps</strong></a> and the THEMIS nighttime IR mosaic.) We hope to get the nighttime IR map entered as a layer of HiWISH to help image suggesters.<br><br>The night-IR bright (warm) stuff is rocky or sandy, and dark (cool) stuff is probably dusty. Dust cools off rapidly at night while rocks store and slowly release heat. If the dust is thin, HiRISE images can still show the underlying meter-scale morphology. Maybe someone will want to study the dust-related processes on Mars, which are actually not well understood. Additionally, dusty surfaces are where we can find new impact craters that disturb the dust and make easy-to-see dark spots.  We'll see if Emily finds something interesting in this image.  <br>
ESP_016954_2245	Newly formed impact craters have been discovered on Mars over the past several years. When craters form over dusty regions the impact blast blows the bright dust off the terrain over a wide area, leaving a dark spot. <br><br>These large dark spots are visible to the Context Camera (CTX) and the Context Camera team reports their discovery to the HiRISE team. HiRISE has sufficient resolution to see not only the dark blast zone, but also the much smaller crater that formed it. One of these craters, with its dark blast zone, is visible <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_016954_2245_cut1.jpg'><strong>in the first subimage.</strong></a>  The blast zone is almost 800 meters (half a mile) across.

This ice gets thrown out of the crater onto the surrounding terrain. Although buried ice is common over about half the Martian surface, we can only easily discover craters in dusty regions. The overlap between areas that both have buried ice and surface dust is unfortunately small. So even though we have discovered over 100 new impact craters we have only discovered 7 new craters that expose buried ice.<br><br>When craters excavate this buried ice it tells us something about the extent and depth of buried ice on Mars (controlled by climate); this information is used by planetary scientists to figure out what the recent climate of Mars was like. It has also been a surprise that this ice is so clean. Scientists expected this buried ice to be a mixture of ice and dirt; instead this ice seems to have formed in pure lenses.  Yet another surprise that Mars had in store for us!<br>

Recent radar data from the MRO SHARAD instrument has shown them to be composed of nearly pure ice.<br><br>The full image shows the edge of one of these mesas with a lobate debris apron extending from its base. Both the mesa top and the surface of the debris apron appear covered with ice-rich mantling materials characteristic of the martian mid-latitudes and thought to have been deposited around 10 million years ago during a period of high obliquity. Ice-rich flows also extend down the side of the mesa onto the surface of the apron, as evidenced by the lobate flow near the top of the image. Several alcoves can also be seen along the mesa wall that appear to be filled with "pasted-on" mantling deposits.

This happens when the ice sheet undergoes the fluctuations in thickness described above. Ice is ablated away and the new ice sheet surface cuts at an angle through several layers. When ice starts being laid down here again, it is in layers parallel to the surface and so at an angle to the older layers. Much later this sloping surface was created by erosion and gives us a cross-sectional view of all the layers and the angles they make with each other. When sloping layers are truncated by flat ones like this geologists call it an angular unconformity.<br><br>This location is especially interesting because the ice sheet partly covers an impact crater that is about 17 kilometers (about 10 miles) diameter. You can see the rim of this crater on the flat terrain in the top quarter of the image. The curving crater rim is partly buried by the ice sheet here.  The slopes within the crater caused the lowest elevation ice layers to be tilted and probably led to the abundance of angular unconformities at this location.<br>
ESP_016978_1730	The lower flanks of Arsia Mons, one of the giant volcanoes on Mars, is riddled with pits of various sizes. These have been of great interest to a number of researchers because they have the potential to be openings into underground caverns.<br><br>Such caverns have some potential for holding ice and offer protection from radiation and small meteorites. These are good things if one is looking for a safe place for current life on Mars or future human life.<br><br>However, this image shows some of the pitfalls of such hopes. Most of these pits are largely filled with rubble and dust that hide any potential links to larger underground areas.  Furthermore, the entrances are steep and rocky, making them difficult areas to traverse. They would be a very exciting, if not safe, place to visit!<br><br>Note: there is also an <a href='http://uahirise.org/anaglyph/singula.php?ID=ESP_017189_1730'><strong>anaglyph caption</strong></a>for this observation.<br>
ESP_017013_1890	This observation shows a series of parallel layers eroding into peculiar knobs and hills.<br><br>These sedimentary rocks were imaged on the floor of a large crater located at 8.8 degrees North, 358.3 degrees East.  Similar rock units are found within several nearby craters also imaged by HiRISE, as seen in images <a href='PSP_001902_1890'><strong>PSP_001902_1890</strong></a>, <a href='ESP_013611_1910'><strong>ESP_013611_1910</strong></a>, and <a href='PSP_002733_1880'><strong>PSP_002733_1880</strong></a>.  The occurrence of similar layers in each of these locations may indicate that they were once part of a much more extensive geologic unit that has now been largely eroded away.  <br><br>One particularly interesting aspect of the layers in this image is their repetitive nature. Each layer appears to be nearly the same thickness throughout the outcrop, as has also been observed in other nearby layered units. This cyclic nature points to a formation process which occurred repeatedly, building up the deposit layer by layer.  However, the exact formation mechanism and the climate cycle possibly responsible for forming the layers here remain unknown.<br><br>Studying the record exposed in rocks like these can help reveal secrets of the ancient Martian climate.<br>
ESP_017015_2245	This image shows gullies in the walls of a large impact crater in Tempe Terra. These gullies look quite older than <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_014153_1430'><strong>other gullies</strong></a> imaged by HiRISE elsewhere on Mars.<br><br>We cannot tell what is the absolute age of these "geezer gullies" (that is, how long ago they formed), because actual rock samples would have to be analyzed with <a href='http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/usgsnps/gtime/radiom.html'><strong>radiometric dating techniques</strong></a> to get that information. However, this image indicates that they have been inactive for a long time.<br><br>This <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017015_2245_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage</strong></a> shows some of these gullies in detail. The walls of these venerable gullies have gentle, smooth-looking slopes which contrast with the tall and steep walls of younger gullies. Their floor is even and lacks sharply incised channels that would indicate recent activity. The weathering processes required to produce such a smooth landscape are very slow and thus must have acted during a long period of time.<br><br>The gullies appear cut by long fractures that criss-cross the crater's walls, and pockmarked by numerous impact craters which are just a few meters (yards) in diameter. According to cross-cutting relationships (used by geologists, archaeologists, and other detective-types to establish relative ages), this means that the gullies must be older than the fractures and small craters. Crater counting is a valuable technique used to estimate the relative age of terrains on Mars and other planetary surfaces; the more time a terrain has been exposed at the surface, the more craters it has accumulated.<br><br>The color and brightness of the gullies is similar to that of their surroundings, probably due to a veneer of undisturbed, homogeneous dust mantling the entire region.<br><br>All these lines of evidence indicate that these gullies have remained inactive for a long period of time. Why are they "dormant," while other Martian gullies appear to show recent activity? Studying both old and young gullies will help us learn more about their processes of formation (erosion from seepage of subsurface water? melting of ground ice or surface snow? dry landslides?). Their differences will tell us how these processes (many of which depend on Mars' climate) may have evolved through time.<br>
ESP_017020_1620	The <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017020_1620_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage shows two craters</strong></a> on Mars that are reminiscent of the Greek muses of comedy and tragedy.<br><br>The muse of tragedy, Melpomene, wore the sad mask, and the muse of comedy, Thalia, wore the happy mask. Martians probably never enjoyed the theater, or were influenced by the Greeks.<br><br>A more likely explanation for the features seen here is that sand was blown into these craters and collected into dunes on their floors, where the winds are less intense.<br>
ESP_017024_2230	<a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017024_2230_cut.jpg'><strong>This subimage highlights a feature</strong></a> that resembles a terrestrial glacier, indicating that material has viscously flowed at this location. It appears that water ice has collected at the head of the valley (at bottom), allowing glacier-like flow toward the top of the subimage.  <br><br>At the top right of the subimage, the flow appears to have slowed down and stopped, forming ridges perpendicular to the flow direction. Similar features are observed on terrestrial glaciers, but Martian examples are not as bright as many on Earth. The Martian glaciers appear to be covered by dust and other debris, hiding the ice below.  Such debris-rich flows on Earth are called "rock glaciers" and may be good analogs for the flow seen here.<br><br>
ESP_017036_1665	An amazing aspect of Mars that is captured in many HiRISE images is geologic diversity within a small area. This image, of a crater in the Tyrrhena Terra region, was targeted to look at the geologic aspects of possible clays detected with the CRISM instrument.<br><br>Fortuitously, <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017036_1665_cut.jpg'><strong>a beautiful set of star dunes</strong></a> are visible on the western edge of a small crater within the larger target crater (this smaller crater is in the southwest [lower left] of the image). Star dunes form when sand is blown by winds coming from multiple directions, which is common in craters. This results in intersecting dunes, forming a polygonal, or "star" pattern. <br><br>Here we show two zooms of the star dunes. The closest zoom (at right) shows lumpy deposits of sand in the interior of the star patterns, probably resulting from avalanches off of the dune slopes. The dune sands are most likely made of basalt, a common volcanic rock.  The possible clay-bearing material is probably within the surrounding bedrock. <br>
ESP_017043_2640	Like Earth, Mars has seasonal polar caps that grow in the winter and retreat in the spring, but on Mars the seasonal caps are composed primarily of carbon dioxide (dry ice). Carbon dioxide is the major component of the Martian atmosphere, and a significant fraction of the mass of the atmosphere is cycled through the seasonal caps every year.<br><br><a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017043_2640_cut.jpg'><strong>This image shows</strong></a> sand dunes that are mostly covered by seasonal frost/ice in the northern spring. When the springtime sun shines on the ice, some of it penetrates to the base of the ice and warms the dark sand dune surface below. The warm sand evaporates the carbon dioxide ice from below, building gas pressure that apparently breaks the ice and carries sand to the surface as the pressure is released. The sand then cascades down the surface of the ice, forming the streaks seen in this image.<br>
ESP_017103_2255	This image shows the degraded rim of a large impact crater which is partly filled with material that is fractured in several places, especially near the crater rim.<br><br>Pits of various sizes have formed along most of the fractures, and some of the pits have merged into elongated depressions. The association of the pits with the fractures suggests that the pits were formed by removal of material deep within the fractures. A plausible reason for the formation of these features is that the crater floor material includes substantial ground ice. When the fractures open, perhaps due to glacial-like flow of the ice-rich floor material toward the center of the crater, water ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere.<br><br>The ice then evaporates into the dry atmosphere, enlarging the fracture at depth.  As the icy "cave" grows, ice-free material near the surface collapses into the cave, forming the pits we see here.<br>
ESP_017171_2190	This observation (forming a stereo pair with <a href='ESP_016538_2190'><strong>ESP_016538_2190</strong></a>) shows part of an unnamed crater whose fill material has collapsed.<br><br>This crater may have been filled with ice, then covered by sediments or lava. Later the ice was lost by melting or sublimation and the topmost layer of indurated material collapsed, forming the broken and bent layer seen today.  <br><br>The original image description reads "Pristine channels in fractured materials on crater floor." That's because when the target suggestion was entered (by me), I thought there were some narrow dark curving channels from a quick examination of MOC image R1601469. This could indicate geologically-recent flow of water, the stuff we're supposed to follow.<br><br>However, the HiRISE images, especially viewed in stereo, show that these narrow dark features are actually the steep edges of escarpments created by the collapse. So beware of believing HiRISE image descriptions! Sometimes our initial impressions collapse.<br>
ESP_017189_1730	A caption for the anaglyph (3D) version of this observation is available <a href='http://uahirise.org/anaglyph/singula.php?ID=ESP_017189_1730'><strong>here</strong></a>.<br>
ESP_017196_1455	This area of Hellas Basin has a number of <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017196_1455_cut.jpg'><strong>unusual features</strong></a> which are thought to be quite old because of the high crater density. Here a crater has been filled with material. This may be related to volcanic activity on the northwestern rim of Hellas. <br><br>However, it might also be related to water and water ice. There is evidence elsewhere that the ground here is ice-rich. HiRISE is now being used to investigate this in more detail when Hellas Basin is free from atmospheric dust.<br>
ESP_017229_2110	MRO's Context camera (CTX) acquired the image at <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017229_2110_cut.jpg'><strong>lower left</strong></a> on18 Nov 2007 and the adjacent image on 14 Feb 2010, showing a large new slope streak in the aureole (giant landslide deposits) of Olympus Mons.<br><br>Slope streaks (dust avalanches) are common on Mars but this one is unusually wide and it began from an unusual extended/fuzzy source area. HiRISE acquired the follow-up image (right) 31 March 2010, revealing a small, pristine impact crater (blue arrow) in the fuzzy source area, which resembles the airblast patterns seen at many other new (recent year) impact sites. We've conclude that an impact event occurred sometime between the dates of the CTX images and triggered a large dust avalanche.<br><br>
ESP_017244_2050	This observation was taken to see if the cluster of pits were formed by the interaction of hot lava with water. Such pits and cones have been found in this region, most likely because there was significant ice in the ground when a large lava flow inundated the area.<br><br>However, in this case, HiRISE reveals that the circular features are a mass of impact craters (note that the word "crater" is used by geologists for holes formed by volcanic, impact, and other geologic processes). The tight clustering of these craters is unusual. The most likely explanation is that they were formed by a clump of material thrown out from a larger impact crater nearby. As such, they are called "secondary" craters with the larger source crater called a "primary". This HiRISE image covers too small an area to identify the primary.<br>
ESP_017257_2360	Stokes is a large, approximately 60 kilometer diameter (38 miles) impact crater located in the Northern lowland plains of Mars.<br><br>Craters this large invariably have a central structural uplift, which form mountain peaks in or near the center of the crater. The Northern plains are largely covered by lavas and sediments, but craters such as Stokes allow us to observe the otherwise buried bedrock, exposed within its central uplift.<br><br>The <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017257_2360_cut1.jpg'><strong>first subimage</strong></a> shows a wide variety of colors and textures in a jumbled, fragmental pattern, i.e. "megabreccia."  In the <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017257_2360_cut2.jpg'><strong>stereo anaglyph</strong></a> we can see that many of the fragmental blocks "stick out," indicating that they are more resistant to erosion than the the surrounding finer-grained material between the blocks. There is also an abundance of dark sand dunes and other smaller aeolian (wind-driven) bedforms on top of the area of exposed bedrock.  <br><br>Megabreccia, consisting of very large fragments of pre-existing bedrock, is created by energetic processes, but especially by impact events on Mars. Although megabreccia deposits can coat central uplifts, it may not have been the Stokes impact that made this megabreccia.<br><br>The formation of a crater's central uplift does not commonly break up and jumble the deep bedrock.  So if these megabreccias are exposures of the deep bedrock brought up to the surface by the central uplift, and are not merely deposits draped on the central uplift, then it is most likely that these megabreccias were created by much larger and older basin-forming impacts that now lie buried beneath the surface.<br><br>With the aid of high-resolution images, and especially the 3D anaglyphs, we hope to decipher whether the materials observed in the central uplift were formed by the host crater or prior to the formation of that crater. Either way, crater central uplifts can provide windows into the deepest and oldest geologic history of Mars. For example, if there was a very ancient ocean in the Northern lowlands, these rocks could include deposits from that ocean.<br><br><strong>NOTE</strong><br>This pair of images (also see <a href='ESP_016980_2360'><strong>ESP_016980_2360</strong></a>) was targeted to acquire stereo coverage of the Eastern slopes of the central uplift (see <a href='PSP_09332_2360'><strong>PSP_09332_2360</strong></a> for an adjacent area).<br><br>
ESP_017260_2225	This image of Utopia Planitia shows some deformed craters. The crater rims are not round but elliptical and even angular.<br><br>The region is interesting because there are surface features (e.g., polygonal cracks) which suggest that water ice is close to the surface. <a href='images/2010/details/cut/ESP_017260_2225_cut.jpg'><strong>A good example</strong></a> is just to the south of the featured image here. Other craters in the area appear old and eroded. Many are filled with material which could contain quantities of water ice. Were these deformed craters the result of an oblique impact or were they deformed afterwards by an as-yet unknown process?<br>
ESP_017286_1430	This observation shows a knob and large crater near Reull Vallis, east of the Hellas Basin. The crater's ejecta blanket abuts the base of the knob. The crater floor and ejecta are blanketed with an ice-rich mantle that is common throughout the Martian mid-latitudes.<br><br>The mantle deposits are pitted and grooved perhaps due to the sublimation of ice. This mantle is thought to have been deposited as snow around 10 million years ago during a period of high obliquity, when the planet's axis was more tilted and environmental conditions could have been more conducive to snowfall in these regions.<br><br>Several small impact craters are visible on the ejecta blanket that appear to have been filled with mantling deposits that have since been partially removed. These craters give us clues to the erosional history of the deposit. Note the fresh looking impact crater at the top of the knob. This crater does not appear to contain mantling deposits and may be much younger.<br><br>This region contains many mesas surrounded by lobate debris aprons that are thought to be ice-rich. These aprons have been interpreted as a variety of possible features including rock glaciers, ice-rich mass movements, or debris-covered glacial flows. Reull Vallis itself is filled with what is referred to as "fretted terrain," which is also thought to be ice-rich material.<br>
ESP_017292_1680	This approximately 20 kilometer diameter impact crater is located just to the south of Coprates Chasma in Valles Marineris.<br><br>Near the center of the crater are some light-toned rocks. These rocks are very jumbled and broken up rather than flat-lying and layered. These observations suggest that the light-toned rocks once existed below the current terrain and were brought up by the process that created the crater. <br><br>Several other craters around Valles Marineris also reveal light-toned rocks in their central peaks suggesting that the light-toned rocks are a regional unit that is buried beneath the lava plains that now surround Valles Marineris.<br>
ESP_017343_1850	Crommelin Crater in NW Meridiani Planum is a large structure which contains light-toned material with layered and stepped buttes. The highlighted sub-image here shows a small crater. The impactor appears to have penetrated some layers which we can see exposed. Other area in this part of the image are covered by dust (which appears relatively blue in this representation). The layering may have been the result of sedimentation early in the history of Mars.
ESP_017347_1585	This image was targeted to look at lava flows in east Daedalia Planum. The flows here have different brightnesses (reflectivity) which may indicate different compositions. The sub-image shows another aspect of the image. A small 0.5 km diameter crater shows a regular structure of aligned ridges in its interior. The origin of this structure is unclear but may be related to the breach in the crater rim to the left.
ESP_017348_1910	This image from the Gordii Dorsum region of Mars shows a large area covered with polygonal ridges in an almost geometric pattern. The ridges may have originally been dunes which hardened (indurated) through the action of an unknown process. Groundwater might have been involved. 
ESP_017384_1670	The bright rock exposures in this HiRISE image occur along the walls of a 60-km diameter impact crater. The crater penetrated into rocks that are made of different kinds of sulfates. The sulfates appear brighter than most other rocks commonly found on Mars, like basaltic lava flows. Within the sulfates there may be small particles (below the 25 cm/pixel resolution of HiRISE) composed of iron in the form of hematite (Fe2O3). Scientists are able to use spectral information from instruments like the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) and the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) to identify minerals like sulfates and hematite on the surface of Mars. The occurrence of these two minerals at this location suggests that water once existed here in the past.
ESP_017405_2270	This image shows the eastern (west-facing) side of an impact crater in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Like many mid-latitude craters, this one has gullies along its walls that are composed of alcoves, channels, and debris aprons. The origins of these gullies have been the subject of much debate and they could have formed by flowing water, liquid carbon dioxide, or dry granular flows. The orientation of these gullies is of interest because many craters only contain gullies on certain walls, such as those that are pole-facing. This could be due to changes in orbital conditions and differences in solar heating along specific walls. <br><br>Many of the other features observed in and around this crater however are indicative of an ice-rich terrain, which may lend credence to the water formation hypothesis, at least for the gullies seen here. The most notable of these features is the ìscallopedî terrain in and around the crater. This type of terrain has been interpreted as a sign of surface caving, perhaps due to sublimation of underlying ice. Another sign of ice is the presence of parallel lineations and pitted material on the floor of the crater, similar to what is referred to as concentric crater fill. Parallel linear cracks are also observed along the crater wall over the gullies, which could be due to thermal contraction of ice-rich material.<br><br>All of these features taken together are evidence for ice-rich material having been deposited in this region during different climatic conditions that has subsequently begun to melt and/or sublimate under current conditions. More recently, aeolian deposits have accumulated around the crater as evidenced by the parallel ridges dominating the landscape.  Dust devil streaks can also be seen crossing the aeolian ridges.<br>
ESP_017528_1830	This HiRISE image shows erosional features on light-toned rocks in Aram Chaos, a crater near the equator of Mars that has been nearly filled with sedimentary rocks. In HiRISE color, the sediments are very distinctive. The rocks show a sharp change in color partway down the slope, indicating a change in the properties of the rock, probably to a different composition. <br><br>The erosional features have alcoves with aprons downslope, and in some cases have hints of channels, potentially due to abrasion by falling debris. These morphologies bear some resemblance to gullies commonly found in the mid-latitudes, which are often thought to have formed due to erosion by liquid water from melting snow. Near the equator, however, snowmelt in Mars' recent climate is less likely. 
ESP_017546_1965	This image centered at ~16.1N and 205.7E shows an area in lower Amazonis Planitia, one of the smoothest regions on Mars. Located between the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces, Amazonis Planitia's relatively smooth surface and sparseness of sizeable craters has made it the type locale for  the most recent period in Mars geological history.  The "Amazonian" spans roughly the first several hundred million years of Mars history. &#8232; <br>    Although, Amazonis Planitia is considered one of the smoothest areas on Mars, it is not featurelss. The surface is covered with small sinuous ridges that are several hundred meters in length. Spanning across the image are larger continuous ridges and troughs that trend in a roughly north - south direction and cut across the smaller ridges. The formation of these features is consistent with large-scale lava flow activity. Sediment fills in the lower topography between these ridges, and occasionally accumulates into larger dunes.  These dunes likely formed from particles eroded off the ridges over time and are shaped by the prevailing winds. Interestingly, these dunes are isolated from each other by several hundreds of meters.&#8232; <br>     Studying areas like those found in this image, will help researchers to characterize some of the most recent surface processes on Mars, helping to piece together the planet's geologic history.<br>
ESP_017581_1765	        The plateau seen in this image is located within Aureum Chaos at ~ 3.7S and 332.9E.  Chaotic terrains on Mars are blocky, fractured regions of flat-topped hills, plateaus, plains, and depressions thought to have formed by the collapse of the heavily cratered uplands.  Large outflow channels appear to emerge from Aureum Chaos and other chaotic terrains leading researchers to posit that these large collapse regions were formed by the catastrophic release of ground water. Aureum Chaos is located just to the northeast of Valles Marineris adjacent to Margaritifer Terra, and it has a diameter of approximately 368km.<br>     The steep-sided plateau in this image has a sharp, undulating surface possibly etched out and eroded by persistent winds.  These same winds  may well have transported the resulting sediment to the surrounding plains helping to form the dunes below.  The plateau slopes are steep and consist  of a series of parallel bright, more resistant cliff forming layers and darker, less resistant slope material.   A good way to see the differences in color between the plateau's bright layered deposits and the surrounding area is to look at some of the blocks  that have fallen off the cliff onto the the dark<br>sands below.<br>   By studying areas of Mars such as this one, researchers hope to understand how the chaos regions formed and how their formation related to the release of ground water to form the outflow channels, if indeed the two are connected in this way.
ESP_017693_1795	This image centered at ~ -0.6N and 154.0E is taken of an interesting feature in the Aeolis and Zephyria regions. This linear feature has a unique thermal signature in the daytime infrared imaging using the THEMIS instrument. It has a higher daytime temperature than its surroundings while also being relatively dark.<br><br>\tWhen viewed at full HiRISE resolution, this area contains sand ripples with some consolidated, bedrock-looking material poking through. These bedrock outcrops are more pronounced along the southern portion of the image and are most apparent in the region of the thermal anomaly. The outcrops trend generally east -west and appear sculpted by eolian erosion. In the area of the anomaly, the sand between these outcrops has a darker tone and gradually blends with the lighter material to either side. This darker sand may be the reason why the material has a "hot" signature compared to it's surroundings, since darker materials re-emit sunlight in the form of heat more efficiently.<br><br><br>\tImages like this will help us to understand the nature of this feature and help us to understand whether this is an exposure of some kind of hydrothermal fissure, or perhaps just an exposure of a darker underlying material.<br>
PSP_001334_2645	This <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001334_2645_cut_b.jpg'><strong>false-color subimage</strong></a> shows the north polar layered deposits at top and darker materials at bottom exposed in a scarp at the head of Chasma Boreale, a large canyon eroded into the layered deposits.<br><br>The polar layered deposits appear red because of dust mixed within them, but are ice-rich as indicated by previous observations. The water ice in the layered deposits is probably responsible for the pattern of fractures seen near the top of the scarp.<br><br>The darker material below the layered deposits may have been deposited as sand dunes, as indicated by the cross-bedding (truncation of curved lines) seen near the middle of the scarp.  It appears that brighter, ice-rich layers were deposited between the dark dunes in places.  <br><br>Exposures such as these are useful in understanding the recent climate variations that are likely recorded in the polar layered deposits.<br>
PSP_001337_1675	This image captures a small part of the northern wall of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the solar system. <br><br>The reason this part of Mars' crust was pulled apart is not known with certainty, so observations like this are part of a campaign to understand the tectonics of Mars. In addition, the canyon provides a view deep into the crust of Mars. <br><br>This HiRISE image captures 9500 meters (31,000 feet) of vertical relief. A sequence of thin layers can be seen in the upper roughly 1000 m (3000 feet) of the valley wall. Since Valles Marineris cuts into the side of the Tharsis Volcanic Rise, it is likely that these layers are lava flows. Below this, layers are not so regular. This lower section probably exposes rocks that have been intensely disrupted by ancient impact craters, but could also include solidified bodies of magma.<br><br>
PSP_001374_1805	This observation features an exhumed crater in Meridiani Planum, an equatorial region where the MER Rover Opportunity has been exploring the Martian surface since January 2004.<br><br>An exhumed crater is one that formed a long time ago and was later infilled with materials and buried. Subsequent erosion has caused this crater to become exposed at the surface once again.<br><br>The crater interior contains a sequence of layers (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001374_1805_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, upslope is to the right, approximately 420 meters across; 1676 x 1344, 6MB) that are remnants of the material that originally filled the crater. The layers were deposited then became cemented as overlying layers pressed them down. The sequence of layers has not eroded evenly because different layer compositions and other factors, such as cementation and chemical alteration, can make certain locations more resistant to erosion. 
PSP_001385_1985	Most debris on crater walls slides straight downhill. In this HiRISE image we see examples of boulders that have bounced downhill, not necessarily vertically. <br><br>A prominent example looks like a dotted line from the top of the crater wall where the boulder took off to the crater floor where it finally came to rest. <br><br>Numerous boulders have slid partway down toward the crater floor, which is covered by sand dunes.  This is actually a small crater (approximately 1 kilometer wide) within an unnamed but much larger approximately 30 kilometer crater.<br>
PSP_001390_1735	While the canyon walls that define Valles Marineris appear dark and blocky, the interior of the canyons can sometimes be filled with light-toned rocks that appear layered. <br><br>This observation shows the two geologic units in Candor Chasma, one of several canyons that make up Valles Marineris. At the center of the image is the wall rock that appears as a linear hill running east-west and composed of spurs and gullies. <br><br>Larger meter-size boulders can be resolved by HiRISE and indicate rock units consolidated from loose sediment that break down to produce these boulders which then roll downhill. <br><br>The light-toned layered deposits are visible in the lower portion of the image. They appear brighter than the wallrock and also have prominent layering, which is best seen near the bottom of the image where there is a steep exposure and dozens of layers are revealed. <br><br>Dark debris covers the layered deposits along this cliff face and forms debris aprons as material is shed downhill. The processes that emplaced the light-toned layered deposits are still being debated and include volcanism, aeolian (wind), and lacustrine (formed in a lake) origins. HiRISE images combined with multispectral data from CRISM (also on MRO) should help narrow down the possible origins.<br>
PSP_001390_2290	This image shows a portion of a large lobate debris apron along the bottom of a hill in the Tempe Terra/Mareotis Fossae region of Mars.<br><br>Debris aprons were first discovered in regions of "fretted terrain" from analyses of images sent back by the Viking Orbiter spacecrafts in the 1970s. Features in areas of fretted terrain appear "softened" as if some geologic process(es) had smoothed and rounded features that normally would be sharply defined, such the crest of a narrow, steep ridge.<br><br>Scientists inferred that the processes causing this degradation must have involved the incorporation and creep of ice in the surface materials. If so, these mixtures of ice and debris could have flowed away from topographically high areas leaving features much less sharply-defined.<br><br>The flow behavior described here is similar to slow-moving glacial or permafrost features on Earth. The debris apron in the upper left of the image also has several subtle "ridge" features on its surface from low sun illumination. The ridges are roughly parallel to the base of the hill and their shapes mimic one another along their lengths.<br><br>Similar ridges are seen on other debris aprons in this region where the aprons are located directly below large piles of debris accumulating along the bottom of hillslopes. These observations have led to the hypothesis that ridges on debris aprons are accumulated piles of debris from a period of abnormally high erosion. If this was indeed the case, each ridge may indicate a change in the climate or local environment that would have implications for our overall understanding of the Martian climate.<br>
PSP_001398_2615	This image shows a portion of the north polar layered deposits (PLD). The PLD are layers that have been deposited over an extensive area at both poles possibly throughout Martian history. They likely contain ice-rich and dust-rich layers, with the darker layers being probably more dust-rich than the bright layers.<br><br>The PLD holds clues to past climate regimes similar to ice cores on Earth. Several of the layers occur in fairly regular sequences, as seen in this image, suggesting that Mars underwent cyclic climate changes in the past.<br><br>Towards the top left of the image, there is a series of layers that appears truncated at an angle, forming what geologists call an "angular uncomformity." They typically form by first laying down a series of continuous beds. Then erosion cuts through the beds at an angle. Aferwards, a new set of beds are laid over this partially eroded sequence.  A similar unconformity exists at the bottom right of the image.<br>
PSP_001408_1900	Thin flows cover the plains just north of the source region for the Athabasca Valles channel system. The flows are mostly confined by a scarp (cliff) in the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001400_001499/PSP_001408_1900/PSP_001408_1900_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>northwest corner of the image.</strong></a><br><br>The more heavily cratered terrain above the scarp is part of a tectonic ridge known as a wrinkle ridge. A few flows can be seen atop the wrinkle ridge, but they are not as ubiquitous as those on the plains below. The flows on the plains frequently intersect, with younger ones cutting across older ones. <br><br>The prominent dark swathes along their edges have particularly rough textures. The darker shade is due to thousands of shadows cast by small bumps on the surface, which HiRISE is able to resolve. Dozens of bright, narrow rifts (cracks) zigzag across the flows. They appear bright because they are filled with light-toned, windblown material. Wind-sculpted knobs and ridges of similar light-toned material are scattered throughout the imaged area.<br><br>The orientations of the ridges indicate that the winds primarily blow from the southeast. Several impact craters are captured in this image, the largest being about 50 meters (160 feet) in diameter. Many bear the distinctive bright rays characteristic of secondary craters associated with the larger impact crater, Zunil.<br><br>Some craters penetrated the surface of the flows, and the boulders strewn around them suggest that the material they excavated was rocky.<br>
PSP_001410_2210	This image shows an impact crater in Utopia Planitia, in the northern hemisphere of Mars, that is filled with layered material. <br><br>The layered character of these deposits is consistent with episodic deposition. Each distinct layer represents a period of sediment deposition. The layers are parallel to each other, indicating that deposition occurred by material settling onto the surface, rather than being blown across the surface in sand dunes.<br><br>The hummocky texture of these deposits suggests that volatiles (such as carbon dioxide ice) are mixed in with the rocky sediment.<br>
PSP_001414_2165	This observation crosses over a part of the hemispheric dichotomy boundary on Mars which separates low-lying northern plains from older southern highlands. <br><br>In the northern part of the scene, much of the surface is covered with small boulders, most only 1 to 2 meters wide (1 meter is approximately 1 yard). In other areas, it appears that sand or dust has accumulated in depressions, forming light patches. These areas also show short sinuous or linear features, likely ripples formed from wind-blown material. The southern part contains an old valley, now mantled by later deposits, and has a pitted texture due to erosion. <br><br>It has been proposed that the lowland was once filled by an ocean. In this case several arcuate or linear features along the boundary slope could be old shorelines, but this interpretation is still debated. The features have been modified by erosion, and in some cases appear to slope towards the highlands. <br><br>
PSP_001415_1875	Aptly-named Mojave Crater in the Xanthe Terra region has alluvial fans that look remarkably similar to landforms in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California and portions of Nevada and Arizona.<br><br>Alluvial fans are fan-shaped deposits of water-transported material (alluvium). They typically form at the base of hills or mountains where there is a marked break, or flattening of slope. <br><br>They typically deposit big rocks near their mouths (close to the mountains) and smaller rocks at greater distances. Alluvial fans form as a result of heavy desert downpours, typically thundershowers. Because deserts are poorly vegetated, heavy and short-lived downpours create a great deal of erosion and nearby deposition.<br><br>There are fans inside and around the outsides of Mojave crater on Mars that perfectly match the morphology of alluvial fans on Earth, with the exception of a few small impact craters dotting this Martian landscape. <br><br>Channels begin at the apex of topographic ridges, consistent with precipitation as the source of water, rather than groundwater. This remarkable landscape was first discovered from Mars Orbital Camera images. Mars researchers have suggested that impact-induced atmospheric precipitation may have created these unique landscapes.  <br><br>This HiRISE image at up to 29 cm/pixel scale supports the alluvial fan interpretation, in particular by showing that the sizes of the largest rocks decrease away from the mouths of the fans.<br>
PSP_001418_2495	This view shows the texture of the ground in the area favored as a landing site for NASA's <a href='http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu'>Phoenix Mars Lander mission.</a> The pattern resembles permafrost terrain on Earth, where cycles of thawing and freezing cause cracking into polygon shapes.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001418_2495_cut_b.jpg'>above subimage</a>, covering a patch of ground about 700 meters (2,300 feet) across.<br><br>(The subimage appears courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech/University of Arizona).
PSP_001420_2045	This observation shows a thin channel between knobs in the northern hemisphere. These knobs are part of a local group of knobs called the Tartarus Colles.  <br><br>Both knobs visible in this image have dark slope streaks. It was originally thought that slope streaks might be locations of surface water wetting and darkening soil, but it is now commonly believed that slope streaks are mini-avalanches of dust. Slope streaks fade over time as wind erosion blends them in with their surroundings.<br><br>The channel between the knobs has a variable depth as seen by the varying shadow lengths. The origin of the channel is unknown, but it is probably not a fluvial channel because there are no obvious source or deposit regions. The channel is probably a collapse feature.<br><br>One portion of it, (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001420_2045_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 375 meters across; 1497 x 1347; 6 MB), contains a bridge, and is probably a remnant of the original surface. A depression that extends from the channel northwards&mdash;but which is not as deep as the majority of the channel&mdash;might be in the process of collapsing and enlarging the channel.
PSP_001422_1750	This image shows a portion of the central mound in the impact crater Gale that is of interest to scientists because it is composed of light-toned layered deposits. <br><br>The layered deposits could have formed in a water environment if a lake once filled the crater. Alternatively, particles suspended in the atmosphere, such as dust or volcanic ash, could have built up the layers over time. <br><br>By using HiRISE images to see details in the layers, such as how their thicknesses vary horizontally and vertically, scientists can narrow down the potential origins. <br><br>The paucity of impact craters on the layered deposits indicates that either the deposits are very young, or more likely that they are being eroded to remove these craters. Wind erosion has modified the layers after they formed, creating both sharp corners and rounded depressions along the surface. Meter-size boulders are visible at the base of steep cliffs, but the scarcity of boulders elsewhere suggests most of the erosion is occurring by the wind rather than downslope movement of material.<br>
PSP_001432_2015	This observation shows a small portion of the scarp (cliff) that surrounds the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.  <br><br>The scarp is of unknown origin. It may have formed from faulting or other tectonic processes resulting from the heavy loading of the Martian crust in this location. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001400_001499/PSP_001432_2015/PSP_001432_2015_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The bottom of the image</strong></a> shows the cratered flanks of Olympus Mons.<br><br>Olympus Mons is a large shield volcano, like the Hawaiian volcanoes on Earth. Shield volcanoes have very shallow slopes and gentle eruptions. The Hawaiian volcanoes form when a plate of crust moves over a hot spot. The hot spot produces magma that gradually forms the volcanoes. Since Earth has plate tectonics, the crustal plate moves over the hot spot producing a chain of volcanoes.<br><br>Mars does not have plate tectonics, which causes the magma to build a volcano in one location making Olympus Mons so large.<br>
PSP_001456_1695	This image shows bright layered deposits near the junction of Coprates Chasma and Melas Chasma, part of Valles Marineris. <br><br>The outcrop <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001400_001499/PSP_001456_1695/PSP_001456_1695_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>in the full image</strong></a> is in a wide alcove in the northern wall and forms a broad mound several kilometers wide; dark, wind-blown material covers it in places. Similar light-toned rock occurs in many places in Valles Marineris.<br><br>An important question is when these materials formed: were they deposited within the troughs after they opened and then eroded, or are they remnants of the wall rock? Analysis of the orientation of the layers using HiRISE images may help scientists answer this question.<br><br>There are no fresh impact craters preserved on the outcrop surface, suggesting that the layered deposits are being eroded rapidly enough to erase the craters. <br><br>In many places, the light rocks have regular fractures called joints. Joints are common in rocks on Earth, and HiRISE images show them in many places on Mars as well. These can provide information about the forces which have affected the rock since it formed, which helps unravel the geologic history of this outcrop.<br>
PSP_001456_2010	This HiRISE image shows a wonderfully complex surface on the floor of this ancient flood-carved canyon.<br><br>In this area, the water flowed from the west to the east. However, the floor does not show the kinds of landforms scientist expect from flood erosion. Instead, the floor of the valley has been covered, sometime after the flood, by some kind of flow with giant ridged plates. <br><br>Some of the plates are more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) across. The ridges appear to have formed when the solid crust on the flow was crumpled during flow. The plates are pieces of the crust that had rafted apart. Very large lava flows can produce this kind of surface, but ice and frozen mud are also capable of forming similar features.<br><br>
PSP_001480_2015	HiRISE image of proposed landing site for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'>Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)</a> in Becquerel Crater.
PSP_001481_2410	This observation shows a region of approximately 7 x 7 kilometer (4.4 x 4.4 miles) located in Vastitas Borealis, part of the Northern Plains. <br><br>The surface imaged is relatively young, as indicated by the lack of recent impact craters. Aeolian and periglacial activity seem to be the dominant geological processes at work, as shown by numerous crisscrossing dust devil tracks and ubiquitous polygonal features, respectively.<br><br>Dust devils form when the sun warms up the air near a flat, dry surface. Warm air then rises quickly through the cooler air above and starts spinning, causing a forward motion. The spinning, forward-moving cell may pick up dust and sand as it advances, thus leaving behind a "clean" track. We infer from this image that a thin veneer of light-colored particles of dust and/or fine-grained sand cover relatively darker materials, apparent in the dust devil tracks.<br><br>The tracks pictured in this image are in many cases more than 30 meters (27 yards) wide and over 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long, surpassing the dimensions of  average terrestrial dust devil tracks.<br><br>The polygons <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001481_2410_cut_b.jpg'><strong>visible in the subimage</strong></a>, which covers approximately 400 x 250 meters (350 x 225 yards), are in the order of 10 meters (0.9 yards) across; in some cases they are delimited by aligned rocks. Similar features in both shape and scale are found in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica, where ice is present at or near the surface.<br><br>Antarctica's polygons and rock alignments are produced by repeated expansion and contraction of the soil-ice mixture due to seasonal temperature oscillations; dry soil falling into the cracks form sand wedges and amplify this effect. This results in polygonal networks of stress fractures and in the resurfacing and sorting of rocks along these fractures.  <br><br>(Thin diagonal lines are artifacts in the image). <br>
PSP_001488_1750	Gale Crater is one of several craters around the equator that have deposits of light-toned layered deposits. This HiRISE image covers the northern edge of the light-toned layered deposit in the center mound of Gale Crater, as well as a small portion of the crater floor. <br><br>The top of the image shows a relatively flat surface with lots of impact craters. Moving southward, there is a large canyon where dark sands have accumulated and formed ripples and dunes. <br><br>As one moves further to the south, the light-toned layered deposit rises upward in topography. Layering is visible in some locations. The surface of the light-toned deposit is very fractured, producing meter-size blocks. The fact that we don't see many loose rocks along the surface suggests that the rocks are quickly being destroyed by winds due to their fragile nature. <br><br>Resistant hills tend to be elongated from the upper left to the lower right, consistent with upslope or downslope winds eroding the rocks.<br>
PSP_001493_1815	This HiRISE image shows dark sand covering bright bedrock in the Terra Meridiani region of Mars.  <br><br>The MER Opportunity rover is currently exploring Meridiani, but is located about 500 kilometers to the west-southwest from here (as of 2007).<br><br>There are three broad classes of terrain in this image. The regular spacing of the dark ridges, with one side of the ridges (in this case generally on the northwest) shallower than the other, indicates that the material is windblown sand deposited in the form of dunes or large ripples.<br><br>On the slopes of and in between the dunes/ripples are smaller-scale ripples. The dark tone of the sand and compositional analysis of analogous material by Opportunity indicates a basaltic composition. This is in contrast to most sand on Earth, which is dominated by the mineral quartz.  <br><br>The basaltic sand here and elsewhere on Mars probably formed from the breakup of volcanic rock via water, wind, impact, volcanic, and maybe other processes. It was then sorted and organized into dunes and ripples by the wind. Two expanses of relatively sand-free terrain are seen in the upper part of the image.  The gray material at upper center has a polygonal pattern when viewed at high resolution. The polygons may be fracture (jointing) patterns induced by local stresses in the rock or possibly from desiccation (drying) of the original material that formed the gray unit. This pattern is seen in the hematite-rich rocks at the Opportunity site. <br><br>The third terrain is a bright rocky unit at top center of uncertain origin.  It is at the base of a cliff, above which is the gray unit. Therefore, the bright material may be older than the gray polygonal unit. Because both units are exposed today, they must have been partially uncovered in the past, with sand recently covering them again in some areas.<br>
PSP_001501_2280	Viking Lander 2 (VL2) landed on Mars on 3 September 1976, in Utopia Planitia. The lander, which has a diameter of about 3 meters, has been precisely located in the HiRISE image, and likely locations have been found for the heat shield and backshell.<br><br>The lander location has been confirmed by overlaying the lander-derived topographic contours on the HiRISE image, which provides an excellent match. VL2 was one element of an ambitious mission to study Mars, with a 4-spacecraft flotilla consisting of two orbiters and two landers.<br><br>Four subimages from this image are available. The first is <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001501_2280_cut.jpg'><strong>an overview</strong></a> showing the relative locations of the <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001501_2280_cut_a.jpg'><strong>lander</strong></a> and candidate <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001501_2280_cut_b.jpg'><strong>backshell</strong></a> and <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001501_2280_cut_c.jpg'><strong>heat shield,</strong></a> and the others are enlargements of each of these components.<br><br>Large boulders, dunes, and other features visible in Lander images can be located in the HiRISE image. The polygonal pattern of the surface is typical at these latitudes and may be due to the presence of deep subsurface ice.<br><br>As chance would have it, this image is blurred in some places due to the abrupt motion associated with the restart of the High Gain Antenna tracking during the very short image exposure. This is the first time after acquiring hundreds of pictures that an image has been unintentionally smeared ñ overall performance has been excellent.<br><br>A prime motivation for early viewing of these Viking sites is to calibrate what we see from space with the data previously acquired by the landers. In particular, determining what sizes of rocks can be seen from MRO aids the interpretation of data now being taken to characterize sites for future landers, such as the Mars Scout Phoenix mission to be launched in 2007.
PSP_001503_1645	This image shows a stack of layers on the floor of an impact crater roughly 30 kilometers across. Many of the layers appear to be extremely thin, and barely resolved. <br><br>In broad view, it is clear that the deposit is eroding into a series of ridges, likely due to the wind. Below the ridges, additional dark-toned layered deposits crop out. These exhibit a variety of textures, some of which may be due to transport of material. <br><br>The light ridges are often capped by thin dark layers, and similar layers are exposed on the flanks of the ridges. These layers are likely harder than the rest of the material, and so armor the surface against erosion. They are shedding boulders which roll down the slope, <a href='/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001503_1645_cut_b.jpg'>as shown in the subimage</a>. Although these cap layers are relatively resistant, the boulders do not seem to accumulate at the base of the slope, so it is likely that they also disintegrate relatively quickly. <br><br>The subimage itself is 250 meters wide. The light is from the left. Boulders are visible on the slopes of the ridges along with thin dark layers including the cap layer, but they are absent on the spurs where the resistant cover has been eroded. This demonstrates that the boulders come only from the dark layers, and are not embedded in the rest of the deposit.<br>
PSP_001507_1400	This HiRISE image shows remnants of a mantling deposit on the floor of a crater in the Southern highlands of Mars. <br><br>The slope up towards the crater rim is visible in the lower right part of the image. The rough, hummocky texture may be related to loss of ice from material that was once ice-rich. <br><br>One goal of this image was to investigate the parallel lines that are visible around several of the large hummocks and hills in the image's center (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001507_1400_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage, approx. 500 meters, or 1/3 mile, across; 1529x1304, 6 MB</a>). We'd like to determine whether these are layers that are present throughout the rock, or whether they are merely on the surface. In the first case, these may be the expression of buried bedrock layers. However, it is also possible that these are related to the mantling deposits, perhaps representing variations in the mantle. <br><br>At high resolution, the lines appear to be small ridges, that are either buried by or composed of the mantling material. In the best exposures, these ridges look like the edges of layers of the mantling material that was draped over the entire region and then eroded off the high places. This suggests the second hypothesis: we are probably seeing variations in the mantle, perhaps due to multiple cycles of material being laid down.<br>
PSP_001508_1245	HiRISE image PSP_001508_1245 covers a portion of a sinuous ridge on the floor of Argyre Basin in the southern hemisphere of Mars (55.0 degrees south, 319.2 east). <br><br>The ridge is one of  a number of similar ridges that split and rejoin as they wind across the floor of the basin and around hills and mountains. It is unclear what process is responsible for formation of the ridges, but glacial, coastal, and fluvial processes have all been suggested.<br><br>For example, they may represent ancient coastal shorelines, sediments deposited in a river flowing under glacial ice, or an ancient river bed that has been left standing in relief as surrounding, probably finer grained sediments were subsequently eroded away.<br><br>The HiRISE image shows that the sediments forming the ridge include many large boulders that are often 1-2 meters or more in diameter. In addition, the sediments appear to occur in crude layers in a few locations. Such characteristics hold important clues to the process(es) responsible for formation of the ridge.<br><br>For example, if the ridge is the deposit formed by an ancient river then it may be difficult to account for the transport of so many large boulders.
PSP_001508_1850	This HiRISE image shows a part of Nanedi Vallis, one of the Martian valley networks. The valley networks are thought to have formed by flowing water in the distant past when the climate on Mars was warmer and wetter than it is today.<br><br>Some scientists have suggested that the valley networks could have been produced in a climate like the dry, cold one of Mars today if the liquid water was protected by an overlying ice layer. Others think that glacial activity may be responsible for them, but the majority believe that the valley networks are evidence of ancient flowing water.<br><br>Valley networks are characterized by their blunt, theater-shaped heads and their approximately constant width along their reaches. They often have tributaries, as seen in this image, that connect with the main trunk of the valley.<br>
PSP_001510_2195	This HiRISE image shows a small portion of the rim of the caldera at  the top of the volcano Alba Patera. <br><br>This volcano has shallower slopes than most of the other large volcanoes on Mars. Unfortunately, this image is not able to help us understand what is unique about Alba Patera because of the thick dust cover.<br><br>Instead it shows that the dust has been carved into streamlined shapes by the wind, cut by small landslides. Interestingly, there are some isolated patches that appear smooth and undisturbed by the wind.<br><br>
PSP_001513_1655	This HiRISE image shows the landing site of the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit. The impact crater in the upper left-hand portion of the image is "Bonneville Crater," which was investigated by Spirit shortly after landing. In the lower right-hand portion of the image is "Husband Hill," a large hill that Spirit climbed and where it spent much of its now nearly three-year mission. (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001513_1655_cut_b.jpg'>View the full subimage</a>; 1663 x 1621, 8 MB)<br><br>The bright irregularly-shaped feature in area "A" of the image is Spirit's parachute, now lying on the Martian surface. Near the parachute is the cone-shaped "backshell" that helped protect Spirit's lander during its seven-month journey to Mars. The backshell appears relatively undamaged by its impact with the martian surface. Wrinkles and folds in the parachute fabric are clearly visible. <br><br>Area "B" of the image shows Spirit's lander. The crater in the upper left-hand portion of the image, just to the northwest of the lander, is the one that the Mars Exploration Rover team named "Sleepy Hollow." <br><br>Area "C" shows the damaged remnant of the heat shield that protected the vehicle during the high-speed entry through the Martian atmosphere. The heat shield impacted the surface after being separated from the vehicle during the final stages of the descent. <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001513_1655_cut_b.jpg'>Area "D"</a> of the image shows the current location of Spirit. Toward the top of the image is "Home Plate," a plateau of layered rocks that Spirit explored during the early part of its third year on Mars. Spirit itself is clearly seen just to the southeast of Home Plate. Also visible are the tracks made by the rover before it arrived at its current location. <br>
PSP_001513_2650	This full HiRISE image shows faults and pits in the north polar residual cap that have not been previously recognized.  <br><br>The faults and depressions between them are similar to features seen on Earth where the crust is being pulled apart. Such tectonic extension must have occurred very recently, as there the north polar residual cap is very young, as indicated by the paucity of impact craters on its surface.<br><br>Alternatively, the faults and pits may be caused by collapse due to removal of material beneath the surface.  The pits are aligned along the faults, either because material has drained into the subsurface along the faults or because gas has escaped from the subsurface through them.<br>
PSP_001521_2025	Viking Lander 1 (VL1) touched down in western Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976.  <br><br>The lander, which has a diameter of about 3 meters, has been precisely located in the HiRISE orbital image, and likely locations have been found for the heat shield, backshell, and parachute attached to the backshell.<br><br>The lander location has been confirmed by overlaying the lander-derived topographic contours on the HiRISE image, which provides an excellent match.  VL1 was one element of an ambitious mission to study Mars, with a 4-spacecraft flotilla consisting of two orbiters and two landers.<br><br>Four cutouts from this image are visible.

In particular, determining what sizes of rocks can be seen from MRO aids the interpretation of data now being taken to characterize sites for future landers, such as the Mars Scout Phoenix mission to be launched in 2007.
PSP_001528_2210	This observation shows northern hemisphere gullies on a layered crater wall.<br><br>Many channels are visible emanating from beneath layers suggesting that the layers are permeable and carried water to the slope face via the subsurface. It is also possible that the source of water came from the surface. The gullies that do not originate at a layer likely did at one time and have subsequently experienced headward erosion, eroding the layers upslope of their original location.<br><br>A mantled unit (smooth terrain) is visible the sources of and within many of the gullies in this image. The mantled unit has been proposed to be remnant snowpack that melts at its bottom to carve gullies.  The mantled unit is less abundant in locations where the gullies are most deeply incised, which supports the melting snowpack theory. <br><br>Deeper incision typically involves more water and/or more flow events. If the mantled unit is the source of the liquid for the gullies, then it is expected that locations with evidence of larger or more frequent flows would be associated with regions of less mantled unit. It is unknown whether the mantled unit can insulate the surface sufficiently to allow temperatures and pressures appropriate for liquid water formation. An answer to this awaits future modeling of snowpack under Martian conditions.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001528_2210_cut_b.jpg'><strong>Within the subimage,</strong></a> channels can clearly be seen to originate at a variety of layers. Also noticeable is the smooth, mantled material located between layers above these gullies.<br>
PSP_001534_1560	Eberswalde Delta contains river meanders, which indicate that flowing water was present for an extended period of time, not just the weeks required to explain the catastrophic flood channels. <br><br>Available here are two red-blue color anaglyphs in which you can view the topography with red-blue glasses (blue filter over your right eye). <a href='images/2007/details/cut/Eberswalde-delta-3x.jpg'>The first of these</a> anaglyphs shows a relatively large area but with 3x reduction of spatial scale (75 cm/pixel), and <a href='images/2007/details/cut/Eberswalde-meander-1x.jpg'>the second is a sample at full resolution (25 cm/pixel, 10 MB).</a><br><br>The former river channels are high rather than low, which is called inverted relief. Coarse gravel was deposited in the stream channel, which later proved more resistant to erosion than the materials outside the channel, creating this inverted relief. <br><br>Meanders are formed when a river channel gradually erodes the outer banks, increasing the curvature of the channel. Eventually the river decides to take a short cut, cutting off a meander, as shown here. This produces what are called oxbow lakes.<br><br>(We previously released image PSP_001334_1560, including color, but acquired a later image (PSP_001534_1560) over this same area but from a different viewing angle to provide stereo coverage.)<br>
PSP_001545_1885	This observation <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001500_001599/PSP_001545_1885/PSP_001545_1885_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>shows a part of a central mound</strong></a> in an impact crater in Arabia Terra. At low resolution, the mound is relatively smooth and featureless, although elsewhere in the mound a <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/'><strong>Mars Orbiter Camera</strong></a> (MOC) image shows fine layers. <br><br>The mound is broad, filling much of the crater, although it now appears to be eroding. Images like this can be used to explore the nature of the deposit, and provide clues about how it formed. At high resolution the material still appears relatively uniform and featureless, without boulders or obvious fine layers. This indicates a relatively weak, fine-grained material. <br><br>The large, elongated features in the image are yardangs. These are characteristic of aeolian (wind) erosion. They form roughly parallel with the direction of the prevailing wind, and the streamlined shape (often compared with the hull of a boat) is created by persistent flow from this direction. <br><br>Yardangs on Earth often form from relatively unconsolidated material, supporting the inference made from the appearance of the deposit.<br>
PSP_001546_2015	The layers shown in this image formed by loose sediment accumulating within Becquerel Crater. <br><br>The layers are interesting in that there are repeated cycles of thick and thin layers. These cyclic changes in layer thickness shows that some environmental conditions varied in a repeated way as each subsequent layer was deposited. <br><br>These variations may be due to annual climate cycles and/or a cyclic variability in the source of the sediment. Most layers are parallel to each other, indicating that deposition occurred by material settling onto the surface. A few layers are cross-bedded, meaning that they are not parallel to the older or younger layers.<br><br>Cross-bedding indicates that at the time that the layers were deposited, the sediment was transported along the ground surface by wind or water.
PSP_001552_1410	PSP_001552_1410 shows gullies in a crater in Terra Sirenum in the southern hemisphere of Mars.  <br><br>This image was acquired during the winter, which explains the abundant frost (the bright material) seen throughout the image. The frost is likely water frost, as opposed to carbon dioxide, because temperatures at this latitude probably do not get cold enough for carbon dioxide to condense.<br><br>The formation mechanism of gullies is much debated. Several theories support erosion by liquid water, while others favor dry debris flows or carbon dioxide.  A major unknown is, if the gullies are formed by liquid water, does the water originate from the surface or subsurface? Dendritic structures, such as those seen in the alcove <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001552_1410_cut_b.jpg'>displayed in the subimage</a> (approximately 1.3 km across; 2560 x 3000, 7MB), form from surface runoff on Earth. Water originating in the subsurface would not produce a structure like this. This alcove is evidence for a surface source for the water possibly required to form gullies.<br><br>Also interesting about this scene is the fact that the gullies occur at multiple elevations along the same crater wall. This is uncommon on Mars. Gullies, whether or not they are found in conjunction with an obvious horizontal layer, usually form at the same elevation on a given slope.  It is unknown what caused these gullies to form at multiple elevations. Their locations are suggestive of a distributed water source, which also favors a surface, rather than a confined subsurface origin of water, such as an aquifer.
PSP_001558_1325	Dunes within a crater on Mars are visible in this HiRISE image. This crater is located in the southern hemisphere where it was winter at the time this image was taken. <br><br>This observation documents new seasonal processes occurring on dunes at this latitude, as well as other interesting phenomena. The bright tones are interpreted as carbon dioxide or water frost. This is generally concentrated on the east-facing slopes of the dunes, which are in shadow and therefore cooler. Some dark spots on the dunes may be areas that have defrosted more than surrounding terrain.<br><br>Landslides and dark-toned streaks are seen on many of the west-facing dune slopes. The general dune morphology indicates formation by westerly winds. However, zooming in on the image shows smaller scale ripples that appear to have been formed by winds blowing from the south and north.<br><br>
PSP_001578_1425	The full observation is of an area covering MOC Images E04-02179 and E11-03026.
PSP_001578_2000	This HiRISE image is centered on a long "strike-slip" fault on the young plains in the Amazonis region of Mars. <br><br>The most famous example of a strike-slip fault on the Earth is probably the San Andreas Fault in California.  The smooth plains here have few large craters, indicating that it has been resurfaced relatively recently. <br><br>The fact that the faults have cut these plains indicates that tectonic processes (and Marsquakes) have occurred even more recently.  Of course, "recently" on Mars is a relative term; it is likely that both the surfaces and the faulting are more than a billion years old.  <br><br>Other interesting features are the moats around knobs and craters in the plains (most prominently near the southern edge of the image) and convoluted depressions that might mark a channel along the western edge of the image.<br>
PSP_001596_1525	This image shows a sequence of predominantly light-toned, layered, sedimentary rocks exposed by erosion on the floor of Terby Crater. Terby Crater is approximately 165 kilometers (100 miles) in diameter. It's located on the northern rim of the Hellas impact basin in the southern hemisphere of Mars. <br><br>The layered sequence is approximately 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) thick and consists of many repetitive, relatively horizontal beds. The beds appear to be laterally continuous, which means you can identify a given layer in many locations across the area. <br><br>Details in the layering seen in this HiRISE image reveal variations in the brightness of the layers and may indicate differing mineralogies. Based on the ease with which wind appears to erode these layers, they are believed to be composed mostly of fine-grained sediments. However, one or more of the beds is weathering to form meter (yard)-scale boulders that have accumulated downslope in fans of debris (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001596_1525_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage, full resolution, approx. 200 meters, or 218 yards, across; 880x1062, 3 MB</a>). These larger boulders indicate the material in the layers may be stronger than just fine-grained sediments.<br><br>It's not clear how these layers formed, but it may have involved deposition by wind or volcanic activity. Another theory involves all or part of the Hellas Basin being filled with ice-covered lakes at one time in the past. The layers we see may have formed as material that was suspended in the water dropped down to the bottom of the lake.<br>
PSP_001602_1700	This HiRISE image covers a portion of the central uplift of the 120 kilometer diameter Oudemans Crater.<br><br>Oudemans is located at the western end of Valles Marineris and just south of the great canyon system by the Noctis Labyrinthus. Images from the Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) were the first to reveal that this large impact crater exposed layered rock in its central uplift feature.<br><br>Such beautifully preserved layered rocks, although rare, are no surprise to planetary scientists. First, layered rocks exposed in the central uplifts are common in terrestrial impact structures. Secondly, there is abundant layering exposed in the nearby Valles Marineris canyon system ó a gash that exposes layering down to 7 kilometers beneath the mean surface. This suggests that layered materials exist to great depths in the subsurface, which is supported by the Oudemans central uplift observation.<br><br>Based on estimates of the depth of excavation for a crater the size of Oudemans, these layers originated from just as deep as those exposed in Valles Marineris and possibly deeper. A comparison of the layers in Valles Marineris and in the Oudemans central uplift may prove that they are similar rock types that share the same mode of origin. The fact that these layers are so well intact gives planetary scientists specific clues regarding the subsurface and history of the general area. <br><br>Additionally, three other craters, Martin (21.2 degrees South, 290.7 degree East), Mazamba (27.3 degrees South, 290.2 degrees East) and a yet unnamed crater (28.4 degrees South, 305 degrees Eeast) also possess finely layered materials in their central uplift features and lie within the circum-Tharsis region. The preservation of the layering and geographical occurrence of these four craters suggests that they could be ash layers deposited from numerous episodes from the Tharsis volcanoes. Voluminous volcanic episodes could have produced large volumes of layered rock that could have been rapidly buried and protected from cratering.<br>
PSP_001630_2015	Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the Solar System. While it is known that it was constructed of lava flows, many aspects of this titanic volcano remain puzzling.<br><br>For example, the base of the volcano is marked by a steep scarp (cliff) that is up to 8000 meters (26,000 feet) tall. One idea is that the volcano is so large that it is falling apart under its own weight, such that the outer edges are collapsing in massive landslides.  <br><br>By combining two HiRISE observations (<a href='PSP_001432_2015'>PSP_001432_2015 </a>and <a href='PSP_001630_2015'>PSP_001630_2015</a>), we can see an approximately 6 km (3.7 mile) wide portion of this scarp in three dimensions. The topography can be <a href='images/2007/details/PSP_001630_2015_ana_big.jpg'>seen in this anaglyph</a> by using red-blue glasses. The rugged topography at the edge of the scarp, with kilometer-scale pieces of the volcano pushed up or pulled apart, fits the idea that the lower part of Olympus Mons is riddled with faults. <br><br>However, this data covers only about 0.3% of the scarp, so more images will need to be studied to understand how Olympus Mons is gradually being destroyed.  
PSP_001640_2125	Scene PSP_001640_2125 shows the very steep side of a plateau, part of the northern limit of the Kasei Valles system, which is one of the largest outflow channel systems on Mars.<br><br>The difference in elevation here between the mostly flat channel's floor (bottom right) and the top of the plateau (top left) is over 1,300  m (0.8 miles), comparable in height to the Grand Canyon walls. <br><br>The Kasei Valles system is much wider than the Grand Canyon, though, getting to be in places 500 km (300 miles) wide. (The Grand Canyon's maximum width is 30 km, or 18 miles).<br><br> <br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001640_2125_cut_b.jpg'>image's subset</a> (400 x 250 m or 440 x 270 yards; file size is 920 KB) shows numerous paths with the appearance of dotted lines, criss-crossing the steep side of the plateau. The carving agents can be found at the end of some of these paths: rocky blocks such as the ones in this subset, up to 2 m (2.2 yards) across (4 m or 4.4 yards across elsewhere in the image). <br><br>Some of these blocks traveled downhill several hundred meters (yards) as they rolled and bounced leaving behind a trail of indentations or poke marks in the surface's fine-grained, light-toned soils. The raised borders in some of these poke marks indicate they are relatively recent features, unaffected by wind erosion, or that this soil has cohesive properties, such as if it was cemented.<br><br>The sound of these blocks falling did not travel very far, though. According to <a href='http://www.acoustics.org/press/151st/Hanford.html'> computer simulations</a> sound in Mars travels only 1.5% the distance it would travel on Earth. (No Martian sound has ever been recorded.) Hence, the same sound which would travel 1 km (0.6 miles) on Earth would travel only 15 m (16 yards) on Mars. This is due to the lower Martian atmospheric pressure, which is approximately 1% of that of Earth.
PSP_001656_2175	This observation shows a portion of the wall (light-toned material) and floor of a trough in the Acheron Fossae region of Mars. <br><br>Many dark and light-toned slope streaks are visible on the wall of the trough surrounded by dunes. Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. While the mechanism of formation and triggering is debated, they are most commonly believed to form by downslope movement of extremely dry sand or very fine-grained dust in an almost fluidlike manner (analogous to a terrestrial snow avalanche) exposing darker underlying material. <br><br>Some of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders, and a few appear to originate at boulders or clumps of rocky material. These slope streaks, as well as others on the planet, do not have deposits of displaced material at their downslope ends. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and can be seen to cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that are lightening with time as new dust is deposited on their surface.<br>
PSP_001660_2570	This image shows dunes on the northern plains of Mars, and appears similar to images taken when the surface was covered by frost.<br><br>However, <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> spectra taken at the same time do not show evidence for either water or carbon dioxide frost here. Possibly, and consistent with the CRISM spectra, this area is covered by dust, obscuring the dark material that is typically present in dunes of this type.<br><br>The orientation of the dunes indicates that they were formed by winds blowing generally from upper right to lower left. Ripples on the dunes show that the wind patterns that formed them are more complex, with the dune shapes affecting the wind direction.<br><br>It is not known whether these dunes are currently active (being moved by wind today) or have been in this location for a very long time, but if they are indeed covered by dust they cannot have been recently active.  <br><br>Between the dunes, the underlying surface of the northern plains can be seen.  In places, it has been fractured into polygonal blocks, suggesting that water ice is or was present below the surface. Meter-size blocks are also seen in places in this image and elsewhere on the northern plains. The origin of these blocks is not known, but they may be remnants of erosion of material that once covered this region.<br>
PSP_001662_1520	Terby Crater is a large (approximately 165 kilometer), Noachian-aged crater located on the northern rim of the Hellas impact basin.<br><br>Terby hosts a very impressive sequence of predominantly light-toned layered deposits, up to 2.5 kilometers thick that are banked along its northern rim and extend toward the center of the crater.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001600_001699/PSP_001662_1520/PSP_001662_1520_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The full image</strong></a> shows this stack of layered rocks as they are exposed westward facing scarp. The layered sequence consists of many beds that are repetitive, relatively horizontal and laterally continuous on a kilometer scale. Many beds are strongly jointed and fractured and exhibit evidence of small-scale wind scour.<br><br>The light-toned layers are typically at least partially covered with dark mantling material that obscures the layers as well as debris and numerous, meter-scale boulders that have cascaded down slope. The processes responsible for formation of these layers remain a mystery, but could include deposition in water, by the wind, or even volcanic activity.<br><br>This HiRISE image is a proposed landing site for the <a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) in Terby Crater.<br>
PSP_001666_1530	This HiRISE image covers the southwest portion of the terraces and floor of Holden Crater situated in southwest Margaritifer Terra.<br><br>Breccia is a rock typically consisting of rock fragments of various sizes and shapes that have been broken, tumbled and cemented together in sudden geologic event (e.g., a landslide, a flashflood or even an impact-cratering event). If it were not for the dark sandy dunes dispersed throughout, this image could easily fool an expert into thinking that this image is actually a photograph of a hand sample of an impact breccia.<br><br>The prefix "mega" implies that the breccia consists of clasts, or rock fragments, that are typically bigger than a large house or a building. The rectangular megaclast near the center of the image is a colossal 50 x 25 meters (approximately 150 X 75 feet). The crater likely experienced extensive modification by running water, which is supported by observations of drainage and deposition into the crater from a large channel (Uzboi Valles) breaching Holden's southwest rim.  <br><br>While it is possible that the megabreccia formed from a catastrophic release of water into the crater, a more likely possibility is that it formed from the impact that created the approximately 150 kilometer-in-diameter Holden Crater. Popigai Crater, a terrestrial crater of half the size of Holden, possesses a similar occurrence of megabreccia with a comparable range in megaclast size to the Holden Crater example.<br><br>An impact-generated megabreccia deposit, as observed in terrestrial craters, typically lies beneath the crater floor, so the exhumation of the megabreccia may be the result of down-cutting and erosion of water that once flowed through Uzboi Valles.<br>
PSP_001674_1610	This observation covers a small part of the plains surrounding the volcano Tyrrhena Patera.  <br><br>Most of this area is covered by a thick layer of "mantling" material which hides the underlying rocks. Infrared data from the Mars Odyssey spacecraft suggested that this area is rockier than most of the region.<br><br>The HiRISE observation confirms that the area is unusually rocky, with some bare patches of ancient shattered rock exposed at the surface. This image is also a good example of how the HiRISE team samples unknown terrain. The center of the image is at full resolution, but the outer edges have averaged each group of 4 x 4 pixels. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be returned to Earth and helps ascertain how much resolution is actually needed to study this kind of terrain.
PSP_001678_1770	Ada Crater is a fresh (recently-formed) impact crater formed close to the southern edge of Meridiani Planum, far to  the southeast of the Opportunity rover. <br><br>Shown here are two red-blue color anaglyphs in which you can view the topography with red-blue glasses (blue filter over your right eye). <a href='images/2007/details/cut/Ada-1x.jpg'>The first one</a> covers the crater and shows a relatively large area but with 3x reduction of spatial scale (75 cm/pixel). The crater looks extremely deep, but that impression is greatly exaggerated!  We acquire stereo pairs with separation angles much greater than that of our own eyes, in order to extract for accurate measurements. <br><br>But the effect on color anaglyphs is to exaggerate the relief, which can be vertigo-inducing over steep terrain. <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/Ada-ejecta.jpg'>The second anaglyph covers a portion of the ejecta blanket at full resolution (9 MB).</a>  Here the vertical exaggeration is quite helpful to visualize the subtle undulations.<br><br>(We previously released image PSP_1348_1770, but acquired a later image (PSP_1678_1770) over this same area but from a different viewing angle to provide stereo coverage.)<br>
PSP_001682_1845	This image shows an enigmatic ridge within a broad deposit west of Pavonis Mons, oriented roughly radial to the volcano. <br><br>The origin of the deposit is uncertain; one possibility is that it formed during an episode of cold-based glaciation in a different Martian climate. In other areas (outside the region shown here) it forms a series of arcuate concentric ridges which may be moraines. The textured appearance shown here of the surface is common in much of the deposit. <br><br>The large ridge in the left part of the image appears to have trapped some dust, as it has a smooth, mantled appearance. There are also many wind-blown ripples in the western part of the image. The ridge itself may be due to a volcanic eruption along a fissure system, possibly under ice if Pavonis Mons was once glaciated.<br><br>Unfortunately, the mantling at this site has obscured most underlying details of the ridge which could clarify the conditions under which it formed.
PSP_001684_1410	This observation shows gullies in a crater in Terra Sirenum. The gullies unusually emanate from different elevations along the crater wall. Several of the gullies are extremely developed and incised, while others have very narrow, shallow channels.<br><br>Many of the gullies appear to have extensive debris aprons, but that could be deceiving. Based on their surroundings, the topography underlying the debris aprons is likely not flat or gently sloping. This might cause the debris apron material to cover a wider surface area, without being as large of a volume as it might appear visually, than it otherwise would.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001684_1410_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows a gully with many channels.</a> Several of the channels overlap or are overlapped by debris aprons suggesting that multiple flow episodes occurred here. In particular, there is a large channel that sticks out from underneath the main debris apron with a debris apron of its own. If this channel originated where the alcove currently is, then it is possible that the past flow contained more liquid and that the source of liquid to form the gullies in this region is now available in smaller amounts for an unknown reason.<br>
PSP_001691_1320	This observation shows gullies in a semi-circular trough in Noachis Terra. The gullies are observed to face all directions.<br><br>It is interesting to note that the gully morphology seen here depends on the orientation of the gullies. The morphology differences are most pronounced on the sunlit slope, with the gullies facing south (down) being more deeply incised than those facing the west. It is unknown what caused the different gully morphologies, but there are several possibilities. <br><br>Gullies are proposed to form at locations determined by the availability of a forming liquid (thought to be water) and/or the amount of insolation the slope receives, among other factors. It is possible that the deeper gullies experienced more erosional events or that their erosional events were more effective for undetermined reasons. It is also possible that the gullies formed at different times such that they did not have the same amount of wateró either for an individual flow or totalóavailable to them. Also, the underlying topography could make the gullies appear relatively more incised without this actually being the case.<br><br>The majority of the gullies on both sides of the trough appear to originate at a boulder-rich layer <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001691_1320_cut_b.jpg'><strong>visible in the subimage</strong></a>. The layer appears dark on the sunlit slope because the boulders sticking out from the slopes cast shadows. If these gullies formed by water from the subsurface, then it is possible that this layer is a permeable layer that conducted water to the surface. The layer is deteriorating and traveling down slope in the form of boulders. These boulders can clearly be seen in the alcoves of the gullies on both sides of the trough.<br><br>Note that the alternating stripes on the left side of the image are an artifact from camera noise. They are not real features.<br>
PSP_001695_2080	This HiRISE image shows a volcanic vent in the Tharsis region of Mars.<br><br>Tharsis is primarily a volcanic highland, containing several of the largest shield volcanoes in the Solar System and many smaller volcanic edifices.<br><br>However, tectonics has also played an important role in shaping the region. The Tharsis rise is riddled with faults and fractures. The area <a href='images/2007/details/PSP_001695_2080_cut_big.jpg'>depicted in the subimage</a> lies between three sets of fractures - the Cyane Fossae, the Ceraunius Fossae, and the Olympic Fossae - and on the flank of a low volcanic shield. The prominent trough in the HiRISE image is a volcanic vent.<br><br>Shallow depressions with scalloped edges span the western (left) half of the vent. These may be places where lakes of lava once stood. The lava that ponded in the lakes probably drained back into the vent towards the end of the eruption.  On the eastern (right) side of the subimage, small channels that once transported lava feed away from the vent to both the north and south.<br><br>Originally, the vent must have been a deep and narrow fissure, but it has become more trough-like with time as material tumbled from its walls and settled on its floor.  This "mass wasting" process has exposed lava flows in cross section in the walls of the trough.
PSP_001697_1390	This observation shows part of an unnamed crater, itself located inside the much larger Newton Crater, in Terra Sirenum. This unnamed crater is approximately 7 kilometers in diameter (over 4 miles) and some 700 meters (760 yards) deep.<br><br>Numerous gully systems are visible on the east- and south-facing walls of the crater; their characteristics are astonishingly diverse.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001697_1390_cut_b.jpg'><strong>subimage covers an area</strong></a> of nearly 610 x 740 meters (670 x 800 yards). Downhill is toward the bottom of the image, north is up; illumination is from the northwest. This subimage depicts several gullies or troughs carved in the southwest-facing wall of the crater. <br><br>These troughs are extremely rectilinear, lack tributaries, and do not seem to have terminal fan deposits: they terminate rather abruptly, some of them in a spatula-like shape. Their characteristics contrast sharply with those of gully systems elsewhere in this same crater, which are sinuous, have numerous tributaries, and show distinct fan deposits.<br><br>HiRISE is unveiling the large diversity exhibited by Martian gully systems, thanks to its high-resolution, stereo, and color capabilities. The diverse types of gullies observed may have been produced by different mechanisms. Current leading hypotheses explaining the origin of gullies include erosion from seepage or eruption of water from a subsurface aquifer, melting of ground ice, or surface snow; and dry landslides.<br>
PSP_001700_2505	The bottom half of this observation shows a portion of a frost patch on a mound inside a northern hemisphere crater. This is the same frosted mound shown in <a href='PSP_001370_2505'><strong>this image.</strong></a> The frost patch has remained largely stable at least since the Viking era (late 1970s). <br><br>The bright frost region is bounded by a dune field on the northeast. Several sizes of dunes are visible. The size classes probably represent generations of dunes that formed under a variety of dominant wind conditions.  <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001700_2505_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage shows the dunes</strong></a> and frost boundary up-close.  The frost is largely absent over the dunes, and is more stable over the ground that does not have dune-shaped landforms.<br>
PSP_001736_2605	This HiRISE image shows dark dunes and light polygonal terrain in Olympia Undae, also known as the North Polar Erg.<br><br>Two sets of dunes are obvious. The major set trends ~north-south, indicating winds from the east or west. Between the crests of these dunes is a second set oriented mostly east-west.<br><br>Zooming in on the dunes, a rippled texture is apparent, probably due to redistribution of sand at the scale of meters and less. Near the crests of some dunes are channel-like features, with some branching downslope. The origin of these channels is unknown, but they may result from the flow and displacement of sand that was fluidized by sublimating carbon dioxide or water frost.<br><br>Bright patches of ground are found in some inter-dune areas, with many having a polygonal texture. Polygons on Earth form from contraction induced by stresses from dehydration, cooling, and other processes, so these features may have a similar origin. The CRISM instrument on MRO and OMEGA on Mars Express indicates that many dunes in Olympia Undae are rich in the mineral gypsum.
PSP_001750_1425	PSP_001750_1425 shows two southern hemisphere craters. These craters are about the same size, approximately 800 - 900 meters in diameter, and appear to have experienced parallel histories. Both craters show dunes and gullies with similar orientations.<br><br>Several generations of dunes can be seen in the interior of these craters. The largest barchan dunes trend northwest-southeast with their slip faces facing the southeast, indicating that the winds forming them came from the northwest.<br><br>There are smaller dunes that superpose the large dunes with a different orientation. Different dune orientations are a sign of a changing dominant wind direction. Both craters have similar dune orientations, which is expected because of their proximity.<br><br>The two craters also both have gullies originating at layers on their south-facing walls. The gullies are mostly in shadow, but adjusting the brightness and contrast of the image allows them to be seen (<a href='../../images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001750_1425_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage, 1442 x 1495, 2 MB).</a> The subimage is approximately 300 meters across and shows the gullies in the crater on the right. Gullies are thought to form by liquid water flowing down slopes, but the source of the water and how it is involved in gully erosion is often debated.  <br><br>One theory proposes that near-surface ground ice melts to form the gullies. An important part of this theory is the direction and amount of insolation (sunlight) a slope receives. Since these craters are close to each other, they receive similar insolation, which could explain why the gullies are in the same location in them.  <br><br>Another theory suggests that subsurface water from an aquifer forms the gullies. If an extensive aquifer existed, it would flow downslope. If the regional slope trends towards the south, that could explain why the gullies are where they are (the water would come from behind the slope to form the gullies).<br><br>HiRISE is showing us unprecedented details of the gullies and will no doubt bring us closer to understanding how these mysterious features form.
PSP_001752_1750	This HiRISE color image strip (1.2 x 15 kilometers) shows a region just to the west of one of two possible Mars Science Laboratory landing ellipses within Gale Crater on Mars.<br><br>The footprint stretches from the cratered floor of Gale in the north (top) onto layered deposits that make up the central and southern (bottom) part of the image. The color is exaggerated over what would be seen by the human eye, but brings out details not apparent in a monochromatic image.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001752_1750_cut_b.jpg'>Bluish material</a> is generally dark basaltic sand, commonly organized into bedforms. In the top part of the image, the terrain is divided between light colored rocky material and sand that fills craters and other low lying topography. Zooming in, the rocky material appears organized into polygonal patterns at the scale of a few meters. These may have formed from desiccation (drying) of an ancient lake within Gale.  <br><br>The lower (southern) 2/3 of the image contain terrain with distinct benches, interpreted as exposed rock layers. The terrain blocks are generally v-shaped, indicating that they have been eroded by the wind. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001752_1750_cut_d.jpg'>Zooming in,</a> some of the terrain has a polygonal texture, similar to that in the lower part of the image. This is shown in the close-up image.
PSP_001756_1995	This observation shows a portion of the central sedimentary deposits in Pasteur Crater. <br><br>The deposits in this image now being eroded into knobs and ridges. The erosion is probably dominated by wind, as most of the ridges are parallel. This is common in wind-eroded features, with the ridges generally aligned with the prevailing wind. <br><br>At high resolution, layering is revealed in many of the knobs and outcrops. The horizontal layers indicate that the material was deposited uniformly over a broad area. Possible origins include volcanic airfall or lacustrine (lake) deposits. After deposition, the rock in this area has been fractured and faulted, forming a diverse array of cracks. <br><br>The mottled appearance of much of the image is caused by dark, featureless patches which may be wind-blown dust. These have interacted with lighter-toned ridges and ripples which are probably also formed by aeolian (wind) processes. In places, the dark patches partially cover the ripples, indicating that they have moved more recently, but they must be thin because the ripples frequently stand above surrounding dark material. <br><br>The ripples exhibit multiple interacting orientations in some places, producing networks of small ridges which reflect movement in winds from several directions.<br>
PSP_001760_2160	East Mareotis Tholus is a small volcano in Tempe Terra, Mars. This area is on the northeast edge of the Tharsis bulge that was built up by many large and small volcanoes. <br><br>One of the many questions we hope to address with HiRISE is the relative roles of the giant shield volcanoes (such as Olympus Mons) and smaller volcanic features (such as East Mareotis Tholus).  <br><br>The anaglyph covers 4.4 x 6.9 km (2.7 x 4.9 miles) and the topography <a href='images/2007/details/PSP_001760_2160_ana_big.jpg'>can be viewed using red-blue glasses.</a> The elongated pit at the summit of the volcano is where the lava issued forth.  The large circular hole just to the SW of the vent is an impact crater. The gouges in the ground to the SE of the volcano are tectonic fissures (called graben) that are now filled with sand dunes. The area is covered with large amounts of wind-blown dust, so it is not surprising that lava flows and other smaller volcanic features are not visible.  <br><br>However, the smooth shape of the volcano, and the lack of lava layers exposed in the impact crater, allow for the possiblity that this volcano is composed largely of ash, rather than lava flows.
PSP_001764_1880	This color image shows a portion of the southeast inner wall of Zunil, a geologically recent (less than about 10 million years old) well-preserved 10-km impact crater.<br><br>The color and albedo patterns indicate that a landslide occurred here very recently--too recently to have been re-covered by dust.  The landslide could have been triggered by a Marsquake or a small impact event.<br><br>Monitoring Mars for changes such as this will help us to better understand active processes. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001764_1880_cut_b.jpg'>The color image has North down,</a> which also places downhill down and helps us to interprete the topography (1507x1409; 6 MB).  However, we are in fact looking down from directly above the crater.
PSP_001808_1875	This observation shows the rim of a crater in the region of Terra Sabaea in the northern hemisphere of Mars. <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001808_1875_cut_b.jpg'><strong>subimage is a close-up view</strong></a> of the crater rim revealing dark and light-toned slope streaks. Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. While their mechanism of formation and triggering is debated, they are most commonly believed to form by downslope movement of extremely dry sand or very fine-grained dust in an almost fluidlike manner (analogous to a terrestrial snow avalanche) exposing darker underlying material. <br><br>Other ideas include the triggering of slope streak formation by possible concentrations of near-surface ice or scouring of the surface by running water from aquifers intercepting slope faces, spring discharge (perhaps brines), and/or hydrothermal activity.<br><br>Several of the slope streaks in this subimage, particularly the three longest darker streaks, show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles such as large boulders. Several streaks also appear to originate at boulders or clumps of rocky material.<br><br>In general, the slope streaks do not have large deposits of displaced material at their downslope ends and do not run out onto the crater floor suggesting that they have little reserve kinetic energy. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and can be seen to cross cut and superpose older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that have lightened with time as new dust is deposited on their surface.<br>
PSP_001810_1825	This observation shows a northwestern portion of the floor of a crater in the Arabia Terra region of Mars. <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001810_1825_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage,</a> several light-toned layered outcrops are visible, surrounded by dunes of varying sizes. The outcrops exhibit multiple alternating light and dark layers with extensive fracturing and small fault offsets. The outcrops represent the eroded remains of sedimentary rocks that formed from sediments once deposited within the crater. Possible origins for the sediments include windblown debris, volcanic ash falling from the sky, or sediments that accumulated in a lake on the crater floor.<br><br>The dark filamentary streaks in the right half of the full image were most likely created by the disruption and/or removal of thin surface coatings of dust by the passage of a dust devil. Streak patterns such as these have been found to change over periods of several months to an Earth year, suggesting that the ones seen here probably formed relatively recently.<br>
PSP_001816_1410	PSP_001816_1410 shows gullies and arcuate ridges in a crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars.  Arcuate ridges and gullies are found together at many places on Mars, which has led some researchers to suggest that their coexistence may be a result of a single process.<br><br>Conversely, there are many locations on Mars where gullies and arcuate ridges are found alone, causing the debate about the relationship, or lack thereof, between their origins to continue.  The bright regions in this image are frost, probably water frost, that is deposited and removed seasonally.<br><br>The arcuate ridges are the wavy features on the crater floor. They appear to parallel the alcove heads (upslope end) of the gullies. Arcuate ridges resemble protalus ramparts that are found on Earth. Protalus ramparts form at the bottom of snow-covered slopes when rock debris becomes separated from the slope face and accumulates downslope. <br><br>There is a mantled unit that covers the majority of the mid-latitudes of Mars that is thought to be ice-rich. This mantled unit drapes over topography and likely contains large amounts of dust, creating a dusty "snowpack." It is unknown how arcuate ridges form on Mars, but they are thought to be a result of mass wasting of ice-rich materials, possibly sections of the mantled unit.<br><br>The gullies seen in this image exhibit a range of morphologies. The large gully in the center of the image is deeply incised with a wide alcove.  The gullies on the west (left) rim of the crater have small alcoves and tiny channels. Many of the channels appear to start at one of the fine layers that can be seen along this wall (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001816_1410_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, ~ 800 meters across). It is possible that water came from underground along these layers to form the gullies. The gully on the far left of the image extends all the way to the top of the slope. It is likely that the water that fed this gully came from one of the layers and then the slope experienced headward (upslope) erosion and collapse to extend the alcove to the crater rim.<br><br>The alternating stripes on the left side of the image are camera artifacts, not Martian features.
PSP_001840_1660	Previous images of this area by other space missions indicate that this is a shield volcano with very shallow slopes. What HiRISE reveals is that it is completely covered by a blanket of dust.<br><br>While volcanic featues remain obscure, the dust does exhibit some very strange patterns. As you zoom into the middle of the image, the ground appears covered with a fine network of light and dark polygons. But at full resolution, it can be seen that these polygons are actually the edges of small scallops.<br><br>The dust is apparently held together by some unknown means, giving it sufficient strength to be carved into this strange pattern.
PSP_001840_2000	This HiRISE image samples the plains between the large shelf volcanoes in the Tharsis region of Mars.  <br><br>The long scarps in the area have been formed by faults as the ground was pulled apart. The large circular depression on the edge of the image is a giant collapse pit that appears to be related to the opening up of crust.<br><br>If you look at this image carefully, much of the plains appears blurry, as if the picture was out of focus. But HiRISE remains in perfect focus and it is Mars that is actually this blurry. Soft wind-blown dust mutes all the features in the area to create this effect.  
PSP_001860_1685	This HiRISE image shows part of the floor of a large impact crater in the southern highlands, north of the giant Hellas impact basin. Most of the crater floor is dark, with abundant small ripples of wind-blown material. However, a pit in the floor of the crater has exposed light-toned, fractured rock. <br><br>The light-toned material appears fractured at several different scales. These fractures are called joints, and result from stresses on the rock after its formation.<br><br>Joints are similar to faults, but have undergone virtually no displacement. With careful analysis, joints can provide insight into the forces that have affected a unit of rock, and thus into its geologic history. The fractures appear dark; this may be due to trapping of dark, wind-blown sand in the crack, to precipitation of different minerals along the fracture, or both.
PSP_001890_1995	Pathfinder landed on Mars on July 4, 1997 and continued operating until September 27 of that year. The landing site is on an ancient flood plain of the Ares and Tiu outflow channels.  The image provides unprecedented detail of the geology of the region and hardware on the surface.  This release consists of six parts.<br><br>1. HiRISE Image (<a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001800_001899/PSP_001890_1995/PSP_001890_1995_RED.abrowse.jpg'>full image PSP_001890_1995</a>): This is the entire HiRISE image.  The crater at center bottom is "Big Crater," the wall of which was visible from Pathfinder, located 3 km to the north.  The two bright features to the upper left of Big Crater are the Twin Peaks, also observed by Pathfinder. The bright mound to the upper right of the Twin Peaks is North Knob, seen in Pathfinder images as peaking over the horizon.  <br><br>At this scale there is no obvious geologic evidence of an ancient flood.  Rather, impact craters dominate the scene, attesting to an old surface.  The age is probably on the order of 1.8-3.5 billion years, when the Ares and Tiu floods are estimated to have occurred.  Wind-formed linear ripples and dunes are seen throughout and are concentrated within craters.  Sets of polygonal ridges of enigmatic origin are seen east of the Pathfinder lander.  Rocks are visible over the entire image, with heavy concentrations near fresh looking craters.  Most of them are probably impact ejecta blocks.<br><br>2. <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/closeup_labels.jpg'>Landing Site Region (940K)</a>: This is a close-up of the area in the vicinity of the Pathfinder landing site.  Major features are named.  The white box outlines the area of the image, discussed next, where hardware is seen.<br><br>3. <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/MPF_parts_2.jpg'>Hardware on the Surface (5 MB)</a>: This image shows the Pathfinder lander on the surface. Zooming in, one can discern the ramps, science deck, and portions of the airbags on the Pathfinder lander (see next image, right side for greater detail). The backshell and parachute are to the south and four features that may be portions of the heat shield are identified. Two of these were visible from Pathfinder.  At the time of that mission, the nearest object was provisionally identified as the back shell. However, analysis of the HiRISE image and reinterpretation of the Pathfinder images, plus an improved understanding of how hardware looks on the Martian surface based on the MER images and HiRISE images of those landing sites, indicates that the glint is bright enough that it may be the insulating material from the inside of the heat shield. The backshell and parachute were out of sight behind a ridge from Pathfindersís ground view. One of the three bright features, identified as heathshield debris, was also identified during the Pathfinder mission.\t <br><br>4. <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/MPFtopo_HiRISE_annot.jpg'>Topographic Map of landing site region (11 MB)</a>: These are maps of topography near the Pathfinder lander.  They were constructed by the USGS shortly  after the mission from stereo images acquired by the Imager for Mars Pathfinder. The x and y axes scales are in meters. Contour interval is 0.2 m on the left, 0.1 m on the right. In each case, the corresponding portion of the HiRISE image has been superimposed on the Pathfinder-derived topographic map. The white feature at center location 0,0 is the Pathfinder lander. The correspondence between the overhead view revealed by HiRISE  and the positions of topographic features inferred almost a decade ago from Pathfinder's horizontal view of the landscape is striking. The close-up on the right compliments the Gallery Pan below.<br><br>5. <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/manyrovers_half_annot_1lyr.jpg'>Mars Pathfinder Gallery Panorama (5 MB)</a>:  This version of the Gallery Pan, taken with the IMP camera during the Pathfinder mission, shows many of the ìend of solî locations for Sojourner, including the last know position (i.e., there was only one Sojourner rover).  Annotations show the locations of rocks and other features that can be identified in the HiRISE overhead view.  The proposed current location of the Sojourner Rover is indicated.  Comparing the ground view with the HiRISE image, one can identify a feature at this location that is about the right size for Sojourner and that wasn't present when the Gallery Panorama was taken.<br><br>6. <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/MPF_HiRISE_pers1.jpg'>Topographic perspective of landing site region (3 MB)</a>: This is a perspective view based on the topographic map and artificial color derived from Pathfinder and other data.  The vertical scale is exaggerated by a factor of 3. The white feature at center is the Pathfinder lander.  It appears "flat" because the topographic map derived from the Imager for Mars Pathfinder data did not include the spacecraft itself.
PSP_001897_1745	This HiRISE image covers a portion of the layered deposits in Gale crater, but is located to the southeast of the main stack of the deposits and is perhaps revealing a lower part of the section.<br><br>The deposits are remarkably uniform at submeter scales and are not comprised of loose sediment, as evidenced by numerous fractures and scarps that run through and along some layers.<br><br>Though there are a few impact craters preserved, wind erosion has stripped and etched the surface of the layers, producing few large blocks and little in the way of talus or other debris. <br><br>The deposit's uniform characteróand the manner of erosionósuggests it is comprised of fine-grained sediments, perhaps an accumulation of dust or volcanic ash blown in by the wind.

PSP_001908_1405	The mid-latitude Martian gullies are found on slopes of many varieties, including crater walls, crater central peaks, trough walls, valley network walls, and mesas.<br><br>Rarely are gullies found on the exterior walls of craters as <a href='images/2007/details/PSP_001908_1405_cut_big.jpg'><strong>visible here in this subimage</strong></a>. This might be related to a paucity of craters fresh enough to have raised rims during the geologically recent epoch in which gullies formed. <br><br>The gullies are clearly incised into the exterior wall, and their channels are not linear suggesting a fluvial, rather than mass wasting, origin. They do not have noticeable debris aprons, but there are dunes nearby that might contain material from the gullies' debris aprons that was deposited then subsequently transported by the wind.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_001900_001999/PSP_001908_1405/PSP_001908_1405_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The crater shown in the full, grayscale image</strong></a> is the right half of an overlapping pair of craters in which the left crater formed most recently. The craters have fluidized ejecta which implies that volatiles, possibly including water, were present at the time of their formation.<br><br>Gullies are proposed to be formed by liquid water, and the origin of this water is much debated. Current leading theories include breakout from a subsurface aquifer, melt from near-surface ground ice, and melt from under a snowpack. <br><br>It is interesting to note that there are no gullies on the interior wall of the crater directly opposite the gullies on the exterior wall. This suggests that, if subsurface water formed these gullies, then the subsurface structure of the crater rim is responsible for the gullies being only on the exterior wall. If surface water did formed these gullies, then insolation likely played a role in the gullies' location.<br>
PSP_001910_2215	Image PSP_001910_2215 shows an unnamed impact crater located in Utopia Planitia; this crater is more than 10 kilometers (6.25 miles) in diameter and 700 meters (765 yards) deep. Different features in and around this crater may indicate fluid beneath the surface.<br><br>Linear features radiating outward from the crater's rim are evident in the upper right and lower right parts of this image. Closer examination shows these features are formed by rocks and finer soils that are located along a straight line; they are "spokes" produced immediately after the impact by very fast outward-moving materials ejected from the impact.<br><br>Because these ejecta came from deep under the crater, their composition will tell us what type of rocks are under the surface.<br><br>A <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/e13_e18/images/E16/E1600704.html'>  MOC context image </a> of this crater shows its ejecta materials form an elevated "pedestal," shaped like a pancake. The pedestal is approximately 20 km (12.5 miles) in diameter. "Pedestal craters" such as this may have formed because ice beneath the surface melted when the impact occurred.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001910_2215_cut_b.jpg'>This image's cutout</a> (approximately 800 x 250 m, or 875 x 275 yards) shows a portion of the west-facing slope inside the crater; upslope is to the right (east). In this subimage, east-west channels, some of them 6 m (6.5 yards) wide, cut into the slope's soils. <br><br>It is not clear if these channels were carved by dry landslides or by a fluid. The channels cut across relatively older, rock-rich, elongated ridges (e.g., location labeled "A" in the subimage) that are approximately perpendicular to the slope. By contrast, in location "B" relatively younger ridges are on top of channels, some of which have dunes in their floors.<br><br>Elsewhere in this crater, ridges transition laterally to ripples and fissures of similar orientation. One possible explanation for these ridges, ripples, and fissures could be <a href='http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3072/fs-2004-3072.html'> creep</a>.  Creep is slow downhill movement of slope soils that are held together somehow, maybe cemented by ice or some other agent. From the cross-cutting relationships seen in this subset, we infer there may have been several alternating episodes of creep and channel formation.
PSP_001916_2220	<a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/PSP_001916_2220/PSP_001916_2220_RED.browse.jpg'><strong>This HiRISE image</strong></a> shows surface features on the northern plains of Mars.<br><br>Light-toned mounds occur across the image. The northern part of the image is dominated by small knobs or patches, while there are features hundreds of meters across to the south. The larger features frequently have one or more craters and an irregular shape; it has been proposed that these features are mud volcanoes, which erupt mud instead of lava. On Earth, mud volcanoes usually form in conditions of tectonic pressurization or rapid burial of sediments. <br><br>At high resolution, the knobs show some fine lineations which may be wind-blown material, but are otherwise very smooth. In between the mounds the surface is rough and rich in boulders. The few boulders on the mounds were likely ejected from nearby impact craters. Information like this from HiRISE images provides useful constraints on the formation and material of these knobs and cones. <br>
PSP_001926_2185	Image PSP_001926_2185 shows part of an unnamed crater located in the Northern Plains. <br><br>The intriguing landforms in the floor of this crater are known as "concentric crater fill." Such landforms are found at high latitudes (approximately above 30<sup>o</sup> from the equator), where theoretical calculations indicate that ice may exist under the surface, mixed with rocks and soil. Examples of concentric crater fill were first observed in the 1970s, in images acquired by cameras on board the Viking orbiters. <br><br>The roughly concentric ridges and throughs in the crater's floor are believed to result from compression caused by viscous flow of a thick mixture of rocks, soils, and ice inward from the crater's walls.<br><br>Impact craters with concentric fill are usually shallower than other craters. The crater shown here is approximately 12 km (7.5 miles) in diameter, and 200-400 m (220-440 yards) deep; <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_001910_2215'>other Martian craters </a> of similar diameter but without concentric fill may be as deep as 700 m (765 yards). Unlike in "regular" craters, the slopes of the walls of craters with concentric fill tend to be convex, and the crater's rim is more rounded. <br><br>All these characteristics are consistent with deformation of an ice-rock mixture similar to what's observed in rock glaciers on Earth.
PSP_001936_1370	Image PSP_001936_1370 shows a crater in Terra Cimmeria, approximately 10 km (6 miles) in diameter. The roughly concentric ridges and throughs in this crater's floor are known as "concentric crater fill," and probably result from compression caused by viscous flow of a thick mixture of rocks, soils, and ice inward from the crater's walls. <br><br>This <a href='PSP_001926_2185'>and other examples of concentric crater fill</a> occur at high latitudes, where theoretical calculations indicate that ice may exist under the surface, mixed with rocks and soil.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001936_1370_cut_b.jpg'>This image's cutout</a> (180 x 560 m, or 200 x 600 yards; 713x2241 pixels, 5 MB) shows a small portion of the crater's north-looking wall; downhill is up, illumination is from the left. In the lower part of the cutout a relatively harder, rocky layer protrudes from the crater's wall; some blocks broke up from it and fell down the slope. Loose soils accumulated behind these blocks (uphill), forming what looks like bright-colored tails. The crater's floor, in the upper part of the cutout, is covered here by elongated dunes. A channel 7 to 20 m (7.5 to 22 yards) wide cuts deeply into the crater's wall; it is unclear if this channel was carved by a fluid or by landslides. <br><br>The channel is cut by a younger scarp (shown with yellow arrows pointing downhill) which approximately separates the crater's wall from its floor. This cliff can be followed for more than 3 km (2 miles) along the southern part of the crater's floor. Elsewhere in this image channels similar to the one shown here cut through (and, therefore, are younger than) the scarp, extending inside the crater's floor. This scarp may have been produced by settling of the crater's floor, maybe due to flow of ice, soil, and rocks towards the center of the crater, and/or to sublimation of underground ice.
PSP_001942_2310	Image PSP_001942_2310 shows a crater approximately 11 km (7 miles) in diameter, located in Acidalia Planitia, part of the Northern Plains. Several features in and around this crater are suggestive of fluids and ice at and near the surface. <br><br>The south-looking (or equator facing) walls of this crater are cut by numerous gullies such as the ones <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001942_2310_cut_b.jpg'>shown in this image's cutout (500 x 600 m or 550 x 650 yards; 2040x2448 pixels, 15 MB),</a> with well developed alcoves, sinuous channels, and terminal fan deposits. These gullies seem to originate at the same height, suggesting that the carving agent may have emanated from one single layer exposed in the crater's wall. <br><br>Contrastingly, no gullies are observed in the north-looking (or pole facing) wall of this crater. Terrestrial gullies very similar to the ones shown in this image are produced by surface water. The arrows in the cutout show fissures that may indicate detachment of surficial materials possibly held together by subsurface ice, sliding <em>en masse</em> down the crater's wall. <br><br>The muted topography of the crater and its surroundings, the relatively shallow floor (300 m or 330 yards), the convex slope of its wallsóall are consistent with ice being present under the surface, mixed with rocks and soil. Ice would have acted as a lubricant, facilitating the flow of rocks and soils and hence smoothing landscape's features such as ridges and craters' rims.<br><br>The concentric and radial fissures in the crater's floor may indicate decrease of volume due to loss of underground ice. Piles of rocks aligned along these fissures and arranged forming polygons are similar to features observed in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica. Antarctica's features are produced by repeated expansion and contraction of subsurface soil and ice, due to seasonal temperature oscillations. The funnel-shaped depressions visible in the crater's floor could be collapse pits, further evidence of ice decay; alternatively, they could be smoothed-out impact craters.
PSP_001948_1425	PSP_001948_1425 shows part of Gorgonum Chaos, a large cluster of chaotic terrain found in the southern hemisphere.  <br><br>Many regions of chaotic terrain are found at the head of large outflow channels that were scoured by ancient floods. Gorgonum Chaos is one region that is not associated with an outflow channel.<br><br>Chaotic terrain can form when subsurface volatiles (such as water) are catastrophically released and the overlying surface collapses. It is not known whether isolated chaotic terrainósuch as that shown in this imageóformed in the same way that the chaotic terrain near the outflow channels did.  Wind erosion might play a role in their formation.<br><br>Gorgonum Chaos is an especially interesting area because gullies thought to have been eroded by liquid water are located on its mesas (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_001948_1425_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage (3.4 MB, 1800 x 664);</a> scene is approximately 4 km across). The gullies have a wide range of orientations and many appear to emanate from a distinct layer in the mesas (see subimage).<br><br>It is not known why gullies form on one slope rather than another, but insolation (amount of sunlight received), availability of water, and regional slope are possible contributing factors.
PSP_001970_1655	This image shows a landslide in the Coprates Chasma region of Valles Marineris that occurred when a large unstable area of rock broke away from the cliffs along the top of the image.<br><br>This mass of falling rock broke into many small pieces as it slid downhill and came to rest at the base of the cliff, forming the lobate (curved) mound in the lower part of the image. <br><br>The smooth textured ripples that are in the central part of the image are sand dunes. Sand dunes form as wind-blown particles roll across the surface and accumulate. Since the air on Mars is very thin, sand dunes take much longer to form on Mars than they do on Earth. The presence of large sand dunes, along with many small impact craters, on top of this landslide indicates that movement of the slide occurred a very long time ago, perhaps hundreds of millions of years. <br><br>This landslide was probably caused by a strong earthquake. A nearby meteorite impact may have generated an earthquake that was sufficiently strong to cause this landslide. Alternatively, movement along nearby faults may have triggered the landslide. <br><br>The Valles Marineris region is cut by many faults and in fact contains many more landslides such as this one. Some scientists believe that these landslides represent a record of earthquake activity in this area. Understanding the history of earthquake activity in the region may help scientists to predict the likelihood that such earthquakes occur on Mars today.
PSP_001984_1735	This image shows spectacular layers exposed on the bottom of Candor Chasma, which is a large canyon in the Valles Marineris system. <br><br>The floor here is approximately 4 kilometers below the canyon rim. The layers are made of sand- and dust-sized particles that were transported here by either wind or water. This canyon may have been filled to its rim by these sedimentary layers, subsequently eroded away, most likely by the wind. The elongate hills may represent areas of rock that are stronger due to differences in the size of the sedimentary particles, chemical alteration, or both. <br><br>One of the most eye-catching aspects of this scene are the intricate swirls that these layers form. Sedimentary rock generally accumulates in horizontal layers. These layers, however, have been folded into the patterns that we see today. Folding of the layers that are exposed here may have occurred due to the weight of overlying sediments. <br><br>Understanding the geologic history of this region may provide clues into the history of water on Mars, because these layers may have accumulated in shallow lakes and may have undergone chemical reactions with this water. The presence of certain kinds of chemical reactions between water and rock can release energy that could have sustained habitable oases in these areas.
PSP_002014_1415	PSP_002014_1415 shows gullies in a trough that is near Gorgonum Chaos, a region filled with gullies.<br><br>The trough gullies, like many of the gullies on nearby Gorgonum Chaos mesas, appear to originate at a distinct layer. There are mounds within the trough that have layers exposed near their peaks. The layers in the mound (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002014_1415_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 230 m across; 944x1034 pixels, 950 KB) and on the trough walls are resistant, meaning they do not break up mostly into small particles that the wind can easily carry away. Instead, they are breaking up into boulders up to several meters wide that HiRISE can see. (The fact that the layers are eroding as boulders tells us that the material is not easily broken up into smaller and smaller pieces, so it is therefore termed "resistant to erosion.")  However, it is not completely resistant to erosion as we can see by the boulders rolling down the slopes.<br><br>Gullies are thought by many to require liquid water to form.  A major debate is whether this water comes from the surface (i.e., melting surface ice or melting snow) or the subsurface (i.e., from an aquifer). Gullies are often found to originate at layers, like those seen here. The subsurface water theory states that water travels under the surface to slope faces where it flows down the slope to form gullies. Visible layers are suggested to be impermeable, such that water cannot penetrate them, which is why the gullies originate from beneath the layers.<br><br>Often gullies will originate between layers, which suggests that there is a permeable layer trapped between impermeable layers.  It is also possible that the layer preferentially traps ice or snow that may melt to form gullies, thus providing a surface source of water to form the gullies.<br><br>Please note that the stripe-like features on the left side of the image are camera artifacts and not real features.
PSP_002036_1655	This image shows a mesa within Coprates Chasma, a large trough in the Valles Marineris canyon system. Multiple layers, some only a few meters in thickness, are visible on the slopes descending from the edges of the flat-topped mesa. <br><br>The layered rocks could have formed from volcanic, lacustrine, or aeolian sediments that were deposited in portions of the Valles Marineris trough. Variations in the brightness of the layers may represent compositional differences. In particular, the slopes contain a prominent layer of dark material that is seemingly composed of materials more resistant to erosion than the overlying brighter layers. <br><br>Dunes and ripples can also visible on the top of the mesa.
PSP_002066_1425	PSP_002066_1425 shows gullies in a crater in the southern hemisphere.<br><br>Gullies typically form when flowing water has sufficient energy to erode soil and soft rock in a channelized flow. The gullies in this image have narrow, overlapping channels and are deeply incised into the slope. Overlapping channels may suggest multiple flow events on this slope wall. <br><br>It is unknown what happened to the water that flowed in these gullies. Some of the water may have evaporated or gradually sublimated into the atmosphere or became incorporated as ice in the gully debris aprons located downslope at their termini.<br><br>Sublimation is a process similar to evaporation except that solid ice (instead of liquid water) returns to the atmosphere as a gas. Sublimation is common on Mars because the temperature and pressure are so low on Mars today that liquid water is only rarely stable.<br><br>The crater floor is covered in boulders (<a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002066_1425_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 500 m across; 2022x1352, 8MB), dunes, and textured material. The boulders are likely a ìsublimation lagî that provides evidence that material on the crater floor is, or once was, ice-rich. A sublimation lag forms when ice-rich material sublimates leaving the boulders and rocks behind. It is possible that the boulders on this crater floor represent such a process. The pitted texture around boulders may also be an indicator of ice sublimation.
PSP_002070_2250	Image PSP_002070_2250, in the Utopia Planitia, is marked by depressions in the mantle, several of which have coalesced together, and possess scalloped edges and layers. <br><br>Scalloped pits, such as these, are typical features of the mid-latitude mantle and are most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees north and south latitude; in the Utopia Planitia, scalloped terrain is found between 45-50 degrees north latitude where the mantle is highly discontinuous. The presence of scalloped pits has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (evaporation). Scalloped depressions in the Utopia Planitia have also been interpreted to be thermokarst lakes created by melting of a permafrost (frozen ground) and collapse of the dry surface layer. <br><br>Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>On the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions are several large boulders (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002070_2250_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage; 1072 x 548, 573 KB</a>). Sources for these rocks may include ejecta from nearby craters, volcanic floods, or boulders emplaced by glaciers or periglacial processes. Also on the surrounding surface is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with scalloped terrain, and indicates that the surface has undergone stress, potentially caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction.<br><br>Variations in the sizes of the polygons seems to be partly dependant on their location with small polygons appearing within the scallops and larger polygons appearing outside the scallops on the surface of the mantle. Several cracks cut through the side of the scallops indicating that they must be at least as deep as the scallops. The polygons may have been present previous to the erosion of the mantle.<br><br>The formation of some scalloped depressions is believed to be an ongoing process today. 
PSP_002098_2220	This HiRISE image shows part of the central uplift of Moreux Crater, at about 42 degrees north of the equator. <br><br>In several parts of the image, the underlying topography appears mantled by a later deposit. This appears mostly in topographic lows and has lineations which suggest that it has flowed downslope, suggesting that this mantle may have been ice-rich. <br><br>In one point near the center of the image, some of this material appears detached in a local topographic minimum; however, this patch is still lineated. North of the image center there are several patches of dark material which appear smooth at low resolution (zoomed out). A closer look reveals that these areas are broken into polygonal patterns, which may be due to stresses created by temperature variations. Such polygons often indicate the presence of ground ice near the surface. <br><br>Sites  like this provide a wealth of information about processes affecting the the surface of Mars.
PSP_002101_1875	This observation shows a portion of the central uplift structure in Mojave Crater.<br><br>Central uplifts are a typical feature of large impact craters on the Earth, the Moon and Mars; craters larger than 6 or 7 kilometers in diameter on Mars typically form this mountain-like peak in the central portion of the crater interior.<br><br>This peak consists of rocks originating from several kilometers beneath the pre-impact surface. Mojave has a very prominent central uplift as it has a diameter of 60 kilometers (37 miles).  In this image, boulders as large as 15 meters (50 feet) across have been eroded from the massive uplifted rock and have rolled downslope.  Fine-grained debris has also collected in the topographic lows, and has been shaped by the wind into dunes and ripples.<br><br>Notably absent from this image are the striking drainage channels and alluvial fans that are abundant on the wall-terraces and ejecta of Mojave Crater (see <a href='PSP_001415_1875'><strong>PSP_001415_1875</strong></a>). These features were likely formed by surface runoff of liquid water, which may have been released from the subsurface during the impact event that formed Mojave.<br><br>Previously, it had been suggested that a brief, torrential downpour over Mojave Crater delivered the water.  However, Mars Orbiter Camera's (MOC) images of Mojave's central uplift have previously shown no evidence for surface runoff, and the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_002100_002199/PSP_002101_1875/PSP_002101_1875_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>higher resolution of this HiRISE image</strong></a> confirms that this part of the crater appears untouched by liquid water.<br><br>So the question remains: by what means was the water, in the form of runoff, supplied to Mojave?  This question, in addition to several others regarding this phenomenon, are currently being investigated by the HiRISE team and their collaborators.<br><br>The full HiRISE image shows that the crater floor south of the central uplift is densely pitted and fractured. These pits, many of which are partially filled with dark sand, lack raised rims and a circular form. This suggests that they are not impact craters. In fact, very few definite impact craters are seen on the floor and walls of Mojave, implying that it is incredibly young and relatively well preserved for a crater of its size.<br><br>HiRISE images covering Mojave crater and the surrounding region are yielding new insights into impact processes on Mars.<br>

PSP_002157_1715	Like the other major shield volcanoes on Mars, Arsia Mons has a caldera (large volcanic crater) at its summit.<br><br>Calderas form when magma (molten rock) is removed from the magma chamber in the volcano, and the roof of the magma chamber collapses into the resulting void. In the case of Arsia Mons, there are relatively young lava flows that overtop the northeast rim of the caldera.<br><br>This HiRISE image samples some of these lava flows. The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_002100_002199/PSP_002157_1715/PSP_002157_1715_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>long elliptical depression</strong></a> is the summit crater of a small shield volcano that fed some of these lava flows. At HiRISE resolution, we see that even these younger lavas are covered by a thick layer of dust.  The small dark-rayed crater in the southwest edge of the image shows that the rock under the dust is dark, as expected of lava.<br>
PSP_002162_2260	This observation shows an area in the northern mid-latitudes of Mars marked by large depressions in the mantle.<br><br>The large depressions have scalloped edges and appear to have formed from multiple, smaller scalloped depressions that have coalesced together. The color in this image (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_002162_2260_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>) clearly reveals several layers present within the depressions. <br><br>Scalloped pits such as these are typical features of the mid-latitude mantle and are most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees north and south latitude. The presence of scalloped pits has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (the process of a material going directly from a solid state to a gaseous state). <br><br>Typically, scalloped pits have a steep pole-facing scarp consisting of small pits and fractures and a gentler, smoother, equator-facing slope. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>A polygonal pattern of fractures (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_002162_2260_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>), commonly associated with ìscalloped terrain,î can be found on the surrounding surface and within the depressions. The fractures indicate that the surface has undergone stress that may have been caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction. These polygonal fractures are similar to permafrost (permanently frozen) polygons that form on Earth and are indicative of the presence of ground ice.<br><br>Scallop formation may be an ongoing process at the present time.
PSP_002162_9030	The HiRISE camera is the most powerful telescope to have left Earth orbit. As such, it is capable of some interesting astronomical observations.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002162_9030_RED.browse.jpg'>This image of Jupiter and its major satellites (10 MB)</a> was acquired to calibrate the pointing and color response of the camera. An oversight in planning this unusual observation put the focus mechanism in the wrong location, blurring the image.  This does not detract from the calibration objectives, but makes the raw image less esthetic.<br><br>To compensate, the image has been "sharpened" on the ground by Dennis Gallagher, the HiRISE chief optical designer.  With this sharpening, and because Mars is closer to Jupiter than Earth is, this image has comparable resolution as the Hubble Space Telescope's pictures of Jupiter.<br><br>The colors are not what is seen by the human eye because HiRISE is able to detect light with a slightly longer wavelength than we can (that is, the infrared).<br><br>While there is no standard observation geometry, this image was acquired on 11 January 2007, 2102 spacecraft event time to be precise.
PSP_002169_1940	This image captures one of the cleaner portions of the interior wall of the caldera at the top of Tharsis Tholus.<br><br>Tharsis Tholus is an intermediate sized shield volcano, much smaller than giants such as Olympus Mons, but still large by terrestrial standards.  While relatively dust-free, this section of the caldera wall is still extensively covered by dust that is being sculpted into curious shapes by the wind and by gravity.

These layers likely formed very early in Martian history, but must have been rapidly buried due to the lack of overprinting impact craters.<br><br>Presently, the light-toned materials are being exhumed as the overlying material is eroded away by wind.<br><br>Additionally, the light-toned layers are overlain by a darker, densely pitted, rubbly layer. The areal extent of this darker layer, which has no apparent internal layering, is visible in the full image. The dark layer may represent lava flows, possibly extruded from the Nili Fossae fissures or from the Syrtis Major volcano, 1000 kilometers (620 miles) to the southwest.<br><br>In the full image, the large valleys cutting into the dark material and its underlying layers may have formed by groundwater seepage and erosion, or by tectonic processes related to the opening of the Nili Fossae fissure system, to which the valleys connect just southeast of this image.<br><br>South of the large area capped by dark material is a complex terrain of irregularly shaped pits and mesas, some of which are also capped by dark, pitted rock. The lighter, layered, densely fractured material is well exposed here.

PSP_002184_2005	Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System, has a mysterious halo (aureole) of material on its western and northern sides. There have been many ideas about how this feature may have formed over the years, but the hypothesis that this is a giant landslide deposit has gained favor. <br><br>Many large volcanoes on the Earth collapse under their own weight, so it seems reasonable that Olympus Mons would do the same. The edge of the aureole is seen at the top (northern) part of the image.  <br><br>It is interesting that the main part of the aureole seems sunk down compared to the edge. It is possible that the ridge along the outer margin of the aureole formed as the flow turned around after pushing uphill for a ways. Imagine a giant wave of rock pushing up onto the "beach" and then receding. It might leave a deposit like this.<br><br>Alternatively, glaciers push up a ramp of rock at their fronts. After they retreat, the ridge of rock is left at the furthest extent of the glacier. These are called "terminal moraines" by geologists.

PSP_002196_1920	This image shows a part of the western flank of Ascraeus Mons. Ascraeus Mons is one of the giant volcanoes of the Tharsis volcanic region of Mars. <br><br>It is a shield volcano, so named because of the gently-sloped round shape. Terrestrial examples, like Mauna Loa and Kilauea on Hawaii, are formed mostly by repeated eruptions of fluid (basaltic) lava. Martian volcanoes can attain much larger sizes partiallly because Mars lacks plate tectonics, allowing eruptions to persist at the same site for a long time. <br><br>In this HiRISE image, the surface is covered by a mantle of dusty material which obscured the underlying surface. This has been sculpted into regular textures, probably by aeolian (wind) erosion. It appears that there are multiple layers, as the southeast portion of the image shows textured knobs standing above a similarly patterned surface. The origin of the dusty mantle is unclear. It could be wind-blown dust, but it is also possible that some of it is volcanic ash erupted from Ascraeus Mons.<br>
PSP_002202_2250	Utopia Planitia is part of the great northern lowlands of Mars, where there may have been an ancient ocean.<br><br>The pits, cracks, and polygons in Utopia have been interpreted as due to some combination of temperature variations in ice-rich ground, sublimation of ground ice, and collapse into subsurface voids. <br><br>This HiRISE image reveals many new details, including an abundance of boulders about 1 meter in diameter over the entire region (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002202_2250_cut_b.jpg'>see the subimage, 2357 x 1486; 10MB</a>). The infrared color of HiRISE reveals two types of materials: the brighter and yellowish areas are probably dusty and the darker and bluer areas are probably coarser particles--sand and rocks. 
PSP_002209_1865	Ascreaus Mons is one of the giant shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of Mars. Based on earlier lower resolution images, this location seemed to be ideal for examining how different types of lava flows interacted.<br><br>The smoother ground on the northwest side of the image is probably a lava flow with a relatively smooth crust much like "pahoehoe" lava flows in Hawaii.<br><br>The rugged terrain in the southwestern part of the image is indicative of a highly disrupted crust, possibly like what Hawaiians call an "aa" flow.  Instead of confirming these hypotheses, HiRISE shows that the lava flow details are obscured by dust.  The dust is carved into a curious network of scallops that are too small to have been seen by previous cameras.
PSP_002244_1720	This image shows a portion of a relatively bright landform named "White Rock" on the floor of Pollack crater in the Sinus Sabaeus region of Mars. <br><br>Data from the <a href='http://tes.asu.edu/'>Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES)</a> indicates that this landform is not anomalously bright, relative to other bright Martian regions. Further, the apparent brightness seen here is due to contrast with other materials on the crater floor. <br><br>Dunes and ripples are visible in the dark material between the bright ridges. Their orientations appear to be influenced by wind directionally channeled by the ridges. Material appears to have been shed from the white landform and deposited on the darker bedforms indicating that the light-toned outcrops break down into fine materials. <br><br>Its high albedo and location in a topographic basin have led to suggestions that White Rock is an erosional remnant of an ancient lacustrine evaporate deposit. Other interpretations include an eroded accumulation of compacted or weakly cemented aeolian sediment.
PSP_002279_1735	This observation covers part of a fan-shaped deposit of material in the Aeolis Mensae region of Mars. <br><br>The dominant surface texture is a series of parallel linear ridges. In addition, there are several sinuous, flat-topped ridges. The sinuous ridges do not follow the trend of the linear ridges, and various intersecting relations are observed.<br><br>The southernmost sinuous features in this image are partially buried by linear ridge material, while in the northern part of the image they appear to stand above it. This could indicate that the linear unit has been more eroded in the north than the south, but may also be due to a more complex geological history in which different sinuous ridges formed at different times. In the northeast part of the image one sinuous ridge appears superposed on another, supporting this hypothesis. <br><br>The linear ridges may be yardangs. Yardangs form when material is eroded by wind, producing elongated features aligned with the prevailing wind. Many of the ridges expose layers and appear to have broken into boulders. Layering indicates multiple episodes or pulses of deposition, while the occurrence of boulders shows that the material has been consolidated to some degree. <br><br>The sinuous ridges could be former stream channels outcropping in inverted relief, where a formerly low-lying feature is now relatively high-standing. This occurs when the stream channel is more resistant to erosion that the surroundings, either due to cementation by water or to the presence of large rocks which are not easily eroded. <br><br>In this case, the sinuous ridges contain few boulders resolvable by HiRISE, generally appearing uniform and smooth. They also contain fractures which in places cut across the entire ridge. Both of these observations are consistent with cementation of former channel floors.<br>
PSP_002281_2115	This observation shows a secondary crater field, which form when material ejected from a larger impact event impacts the Martian surface. One impact event, depending on the size of the impactor, can form hundreds of millions of secondary craters at essentially the same time.<br><br>Primary craters (those created directly from an impactor from space) can be the same size as secondary craters, which makes dating surfaces based on the number of accumulated craters difficult to near-impossible.  Secondary craters are distinguished from primaries based on their morphologies. They are sometimes irregularly shaped, as seen in this image, because they form at relatively low velocities. The velocity of the impactor determines a craterís size, shape, and depth, with lower energy impacts forming shallow, less-developed craters and higher energy impacts forming deeper, more regular craters.<br><br>Secondary craters often occur in clusters, as seen here, as a piece of ejecta breaks up before hitting the surface.  Primary craters form at random locations globally.  Secondary clusters are more likely to be found in groups because of their formation mechanism.<br>
PSP_002291_1335	This observation shows the complex, gullied western wall of a kilometer-deep impact crater in the Terra Sirenum region. This is an interesting crater because it appears to be mantled by the fluidized ejecta blanket of a slightly smaller crater just to the West. <br><br>A diverse set of gullies originate at multiple elevations along the crater wall. Prominent gullies have incised through the overlying ejecta into the upper walls to reveal numerous resistant dark layers. The floors of these gullies display a host of interesting features, including braided middle reaches, cut banks, channel bars, and stream terracing. These are all features suggestive of water flow.<br><br>Miniature gully systems, less than a kilometer long, start much further downslope than the larger gullies yet display the usual gully attributes, including theater-headed alcove source regions, incised middle reaches, and overlapping alluvial fans at their lower reaches. Detailed studies of these and other gully systems should help to elucidate the gully formation mechanisms. <br>
PSP_002296_1215	This image, near the southeast rim of Peneus Patera crater, is marked by depressions in the mantle with scalloped edges. Several of the depressions have apparently coalesced together.<br><br>These features are most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees North and South latitude. Their presence has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice by sublimation (evaporation).  <br><br>Steep scarps consistently face the south pole while more gentle slopes face in the direction of the equator. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>A polygonal pattern of fractures, commonly associated with "scalloped terrain," can be found on the surface surrounding and within the depressions. The fractures indicate that the surface has undergone stress that may have been caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction.<br><br>Scallop formation is believed to be an ongoing process at the present time.<br>
PSP_002320_1415	This image captures a tongue-shaped lobate flow feature along a interior crater wall located in <br>eastern Hellas Planitia.<br><br>The flow feature is approximately 5 kilometers long and 1 kilometer wide with a partial double inner ridge and raised outer margin. The flow feature's surface is generally devoid of impact craters and parts of its outer margin have deflected around obstacles.<br><br>Similar flow features, though not as distinctively tongue-shaped as this one, are found in many other craters throughout the southern mid-latitudes of Mars.<br><br>Recent studies of these flow features have determined a latitudinal dependence to which side of the crater interior these features are formed upon. For this particular flow feature, it has formed on the pole-facing slope. This polar or equatorial-facing preference has implications for the amount of solar isolation these slopes are receiving, which may be a result of recent climate change due to shifts from low to high obliquity.<br><br>Although these Martian flow features may have Earth analogs such as rock glaciers, uncertainty remains as to what types of fluvial, glacial and mass-wasting processes are involved in their formation. This particular flow feature was imaged previously by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) onboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.<br>

This unit is laterally extensive and the same unit that the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity was sitting on about 400 kilometers to the southwest (in 2007). Based on observations by Opportunity, this unit is interpreted to be a thin aeolian (wind-blown) mantle of basaltic sand and hematite concretions sitting on the etched terrain.<br><br>The etched terrain in this image is split into two units. The darker unit at the top of the image is filling in an approximately 120 kilometer NW-SE trending valley, while the brighter etched terrain in the middle of the image is stratigraphically and topographically higher than the lower etched terrain in the valley. This upper etched terrain is a plateau-forming unit with a geomorphic pattern that ranges from relatively flat plains to dissected plateaus and mesas. The lower etched terrain is flat with low albedo, and covered in dunes. <br><br>It is in these etched terrains that <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM,</strong></a> and previously OMEGA, have detected hydrated sulfates, which makes a sedimentary origin seems most likely for these layered deposits of etched terrain found in Meridiani.<br>
PSP_002345_1095	The south polar layered deposits are a stack of layered ice up to 3000 meters (9800 feet) thick which is similar to terrestrial ice sheets.

Smaller dunes and ripples can be seen on the surfaces of the larger linear dunes. In the low lying areas between dunes, one can see a network of cracks that are reminiscent of the surface of the polar layered deposits, indicating that this mound is probably mostly ice with a thinner and incomplete covering of dunes. <br><br>The dark spots in the frost cover are characteristic of how this terrain defrosts, and are commonly observed in these locations during this season.<br>
PSP_002347_1915	This image was targeted to a dark spot seen in a MOC image that was suggested to be the Beagle 2 landing site (see <a href='http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00000321/'>Beagle 2 Landing Site Located?</a> for more information). <br><br>The dark spot corresponds to an impact crater, which is <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002347_1915_cut_b.jpg'>shown in color here (795 x 712; 1.7 MB.)</a> The European Beagle 2 lander was carried by the Mars Express orbiting spacecraft and released into the Martian atmosphere in December 2003, but has not been heard from since.
PSP_002390_1320	PSP_002390_1320 shows gullies in a trough in Noachis Terra.<br><br>The trough is actually one section of a "trough crater." Here the term ìtrough craterî refers to a roughly circular trough that appears to follow the wall of a crater. A great deal of geologic activity is needed to transform an impact crater into a trough crater.  First, the crater must have been filled in with some type of sediment. Second, the outer edge of the filling must have been scooped out by an unknown process, leaving a trough in the form of a ring inside the crater.<br><br>The trough in PSP_002390_1320 is located on the north wall of the southern end of the trough crater. Gullies can be seen to start at multiple levels on this wall. The Martian gullies are thought to require some amount of liquid water to form, although carbon dioxide and dry debris flows have also been suggested as erosional materials.  The start of gullies across Mars are often correlated with layers as seen here. What is particularly interesting about these gullies is that the heads (tops) of the gullies are located at many elevations along the same slope, and that each elevation with gullies has an associated set of layers.<br><br>One thing to notice is that often a layer correlated with a gully is most eroded where the gully occurs. (See, for example, the gullies located in the bottom center of the image <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002390_1320_cut_b.jpg'>and the subimage,</a> approximately 2 km across; 4000 x 3000, 11 MB). At the bottom center, there are two gullies present, and the layer where they appear to originate is most eroded where the gullies exist. In the subimage, the deeper gully channels correspond to locations where the layers have been more eroded. This suggests that undermining may be occurring. Undermining often happens when water from the subsurface reaches the surface and destabilizes nearby material. The water erodes material in its way, which can create an overhang. Once this overhang becomes unstable, it will collapse.<br><br>This might be the reason that the layers are the most eroded near the gullies. It would support a subsurface origin for the water that formed these gullies. Undermining can also be generated by surface water if a weak, easily erodible layer lies beneath a stronger layer.<br><br>For more information, see Gulick, V.C. et al.

These are features which occur on crater walls, hills, and other slopes on Mars.<br><br>They always begin at a point source and widen downslope, sometimes weaving around existing topographic features (such as dunes or craters), but other times they flow over them. Many slope streaks do not show topographic relief in available images, and there are no observable deposits of displaced materials surrounding their borders.<br><br>In general, slope streaks tend to be many hundreds of meters long and less than 200 meters wide. They are observed in varying shades of darkness, where lighter-toned streaks appear to be older than darker ones. The formation mechanism responsible for slope streaks is still under debate; theories range from dry dust avalanches (most widely-accepted theory) to briney water seepage.<br><br>Slope streak formation is among the few surface processes known to be currently active on Mars, making slope streaks some of the youngest features on Mars.  <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002396_1900_cut_b.jpg'><strong>A comparison of this HiRISE image</strong></a> with <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/e01_e06/images/E04/E0401817.html'>MOC image E04-01817</a> shows that three new slope streaks have formed during the six years separating these images (2001 - 2007).

PSP_002419_1675	This <a href='images/2010/details/cut/PSP_002419_1675_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage</strong></a> shows layering in a light-toned deposit in Melas Chasma.<br><br>The layers are sedimentary in origin, but there are many processes that could have deposited them, such as volcanic airfall from explosive eruptions, or dust-size particles settling out of the atmosphere due to cyclic changes, and deposition in standing bodies of water.<br><br>By looking at the slopes in the layers and how the layers intersect each other, scientists can rule out various origins. A darker material can be seen covering much of the layered deposit. Some of this dark material is loose and can be seen accumulating as debris aprons at the base of steep slopes. Other dark material appears indurated and has been eroded by the wind to form etched edges with topographic expressions.<br><br>The lack of impact craters on the layered deposit indicates that it is a relatively young deposit, or the craters have been removed by the wind, or the deposit was quickly buried and is now being exhumed.<br>
PSP_002420_2040	These pits formed through collapse above an underground void. The movement of rock along faults may have created this void deep underground. <br><br>Faults are commonly thought of as planar cracks in the ground. In reality, faults have very rough surfaces that can create voids as the rocks slide along the fault. Alternatively, the movement of magma (molten rock) underground may have also created such underground voids. As magma moves underground, it pushes aside the bedrock, making an underground tunnel. This tunnel remains behind as the magma drains away and subsequent collapse can occur into it. A combination of processes may also result in pit crater formation, as faults are pre-made passageways for the magma to move underground. <br><br>There is much evidence of faulting in this scene. The series of stair-stepped cliffs are actually faults, with each cliff representing the approximate location of a fault. Thus it seems likely that faults played an important role in the formation of these pit craters.<br><br>The role of magma flow in the formation of these pit craters remains unknown. The presence of eruptive vents near these pits would be a clue to the past presence of magma. Such vents are not observed in this image, although the absence of these vents does not rule out magma. Magma does not always erupt at the surface and can remain entirely underground.
PSP_002432_1525	Image PSP_002432_1525 samples part of an ancient lava plain in Thaumasia Planum. The stack of lava flows has been folded into ridges the size of a chain of hills, as can be seen in the center of the image.<br><br>The lava and the ridge has been degraded by erosion.  The numerous craters and dunes attest to two of the erosional processesómeteorite impacts and the wind.
PSP_002439_2265	This image, of the northern plains of Mars, is marked by depressions in a layer of material that covers the region. The depressions, several of which have coalesced together, have scalloped edges and layers in their walls.<br><br>Features such as these are most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees north and south latitude. Their presence has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly ground ice, by sublimation (evaporation). This process is believed to be ongoing today.<br><br>In this image, steeper scarps with layers consistently face the north pole while more gentle slopes without layers face in the direction of the equator. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>Large boulders, some several meters in length, are scattered within the depressions and on the surrounding surface. Also on the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with "scalloped terrain," and indicates that the surface has undergone stress potentially caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction.
PSP_002455_1320	This observation shows the edge of a dark dune field on the floor of Proctor Crater, a 150 kilometer diameter crater in the southern highlands of Mars.<br><br><a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002455_1320_cut_b.jpg'><strong>The subimage</strong></a> is a close-up view of the dark dunes. These dunes are most likely composed of basaltic sand that has collected on the bottom of the crater. Superimposed on their surface are smaller secondary dunes which are commonly seen on terrestrial dunes of this size. Near the crests of the dark dunes are bright patches of frost. Dark spots within the frost patches are areas where defrosting is occurring. <br><br>Many smaller and brighter bed forms, most likely small dunes or granule ripples, cover the substrate between the larger dark dunes as well as most of the floor of Proctor Crater. In many locations, large boulders are seen on the same surfaces as the bright bed forms. The dark dunes stratigraphically overlie the small bright bed forms indicating that the darker dunes formed more recently. <br><br>However in several areas, the dark dunes appear to influence the orientation of the small bright dunes, possibly by wind flowing around the larger dunes, suggesting that both dark and bright bed forms are coeval.<br>
PSP_002464_1745	This HiRISE image shows the interior of Gale Crater, a region being considered as a landing site for the 2009 Mars Science Laboratory.<br><br>Gale is distinguished from many other craters on Mars by a large interior layered mound that extends to the height of the crater rim. The top part of this image contains portions of the southeast part of the mound, with the bottom part showing details of the crater floor.  <br><br>The mound material here is exposed as several distinct smaller hills. Close up, the hills show abundant rocks and debris aprons on their flanks, lacking distinct bedrock layers seen elsewhere on Mars. This suggests that the mound material is friable and easily eroded by the wind over time.<br><br>Other evidence of wind activity includes bright bedforms near the top of the image and dark bedforms and sand sheets at bottom. Between the hills and dark sand are a series of stacked stratigraphic units. Polygons are seen in some of the units, indicating contraction due to water loss, cooling, or some other process. Many of the polygons seem highly fractured.<br><br>Possible crossbeds are seen in some of the rock exposures near the bottom of the image. This and other images of Gale will be studied over the coming months and years in order to better understand the geology and further assess the potential as a future landing site.
PSP_002472_1810	The layers <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002472_1810_cut_b.jpg'>seen in this HiRISE subimage</a> of Echus Chasma are very different from the light-toned, thinly bedded layers HiRISE has observed in deposits seen elsewhere in Valles Marineris. <br><br>The view of these layers in Echus Chasma shows they are rough, with knobs of rock sticking out through the dust and talus (loose debris) on the slope. This indicates that perhaps these layers are made of different materials than the light-toned deposits, which appear more friable in nature.<br><br>These rough layers may be exposures of lavas, or they might just be more resistant forms of sedimentary rocks. The layers are typical of those seen in chasma slopes and crater rims elsewhere on the Martian surface.<br>
PSP_002478_1770	This image shows the edge of a mound of sediments in the center of a large impact crater near Amenthes Planum. <br><br>The mound probably once filled much more of the crater, but it is now eroding away. HiRISE shows a variety of layers. A broad view shows several small plateaus which have likely been preserved by a relatively resistant cap layer, while other levels are exposed elsewhere. <br><br>The <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002478_1770_cut_b.jpg'>subsection highlighted here (3000 x 3000, 9 MB)</a> shows several types of layers exposed in a pit. These variations point to a relatively complex geologic history at this site. Some layers appear to be fracturing into boulders which roll downslope, while others appear relatively smooth. There are also variations in tone, from light to dark. This diversity may be due to different types of rock, as well as varying strength.<br><br>Images such as this one indicate that rocks formed on Mars in a variety of ways, and by careful analysis it may be possible to deduce some of the history that has produced the geology at this site.
PSP_002532_0935	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>At the very beginning of spring in the southern hemisphere on Mars the ground is covered with a seasonal layer of carbon dioxide ice. In this image there are two lanes of undisturbed ice bordered by two lanes peppered with fans of dark dust.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002532_0935_cut_b.jpg'>When we zoom in to the subimage</a>, the fans are seen to be pointed in the same direction, dust carried along by the prevailing wind. The fans seem to emanate from spider-like features.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002532_0935_cut_c.jpg'>The second subimage zooms in</a> to full HiRISE resolution to reveal the nature of the "spiders." The arms are channels carved in the surface, blanketed by the seasonl carbon dioxide ice. The seasonal ice, warmed from below, evaporates and the gas is carried along the channels. Wherever a weak spot is found the gas vents to the top of the seasonal ice, carrying along dust from below.  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002532_0935_anacut_d.jpg'>The anaglyph</a> of this spider shows that these channels are deep, deepening and widening as they converge. Spiders like this are often draped over the local topography and often channels get larger as they go uphill. This is consistent with a gas eroding the channels.  <br><br>A different channel morphology is apparent in the lanes not showing fans. In these regions the channels are dense, more like lace, and are not radially organized. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002532_0935_cut_e.jpg'>third subimage</a> shows an example of "lace." 
PSP_002538_1720	Ius Chasma is one of several canyons that make up Valles Marineris, the largest canyon system in the Solar System.<br><br>The canyons likely formed by extension in association with the development of the Tharsis plateau and volcanoes to the west. Wind and possibly water have modified the canyons after they formed.<br><br>This observation shows the floor of Ius Chasma. The floor is bounded to the north and south by higher standing wallrock, with a few exposures of wallrock seen in the north (top) of the picture. Much of the floor is covered by ripples that are oriented approximately north-south, indicating an east to west wind flow, parallel to the orientation of Ius Chasma.<br><br>Layered deposits and bright patches of material are also seen along portions of the Ius Chasma floor. The layered deposits appear distinct in morphology from the nearby wallrock. These layered deposits could be lava flows, sediments deposited in a former lake, or fines that settled out from the atmosphere over time, such as dust or volcanic ash.<br><br>The bright outcrops visible <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_002500_002599/PSP_002538_1720/PSP_002538_1720_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>further south in the image</strong></a> have been seen elsewhere in Valles Marineris as well as other locations on Mars and tend to have mineral signatures consistent with sulfates. Data from the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> instrument (also on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) of the composition of these bright patches in Ius Chasma could shed insight into their origin.<br>
PSP_002542_1080	Image PSP_002542_1080 is a view of the sand dune field in Richardson Crater covered with seasonal frost. <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_000542_1080_cut_b.jpg'>subimage is a close-up view (1 MB)</a> of defrosting patterns on the dunes. The frost is a combination of frozen carbon dioxide and some water ice that covers the dunes in the winter and spring. As the seasonal frost sublimes away, odd features such as spots, fans, and streaks form. <br><br>Small dark streaks on the dune slip face slopes may be where recent avalanches of sand, or perhaps wind, has moved the dark sand underlying the frost, or where frost has been removed to expose the sand. Alternatively, the dark streaks may be patches of coarse-grained ice that are clear enough so that the dark material below the ice is visible. The slip faces indicate that the general direction of sand transport is from the right to the left across the image.<br><br>It has been hypothesized that the dark spots and fans may be "geysers" or "cold gas jets" that form when sublimation processes trap gas at the bottom of the ice. The gas is released through cracks in the ice, entraining dust from below the ice and scattering it onto the surface to form the dark spots and fans. <br><br>The high resolution, stereo, and low light imaging capabilities of HiRISE has provided new insight into the processes that form these features. Repeated imaging in a variety of locations will provide a record of their development and evolution.
PSP_002545_1430	Martian outflow channels are believed to be some of the largest features formed from the catastrophic flooding that scoured the landscape during ancient times. The source of the water likely originated in the subsurface and was somehow disturbed, depressurizing an aquifer, causing a sudden burst of water onto the surface. <br><br>This image shows multiple branches of the outflow channel Dao Vallis, which flows towards the west (left), ending near Hellas Basin. Although it is not clear exactly where the water that created these floods ended up, it is possible that Dao Vallis and its neighboring outflow channel, Niger Vallis, deposited water in Hellas Basin and formed a short-lived lake.<br><br>Within the floor of Dao Vallis is material that appears striped, known as "lineated valley fill."  Valley fill material is thought to be ice-rich material that has flowed or been deposited onto the floor. Several lineations or "flow lines" appear to merge towards the upper left of the scene which supports this idea that the fill materials flowed, similar to slow-moving glacial material on Earth.<br><br>Also present in this scene is a mantling deposit which drapes much of the mid-latitudes of Mars.  The deposit or "mantle" can be seen on south-facing slopes of positive-relief features, appearing as if it's sliding off the walls. The mantle material is thought to be ice-cemented dust  that was deposited during times when snowfall occurred on Mars. <br><br>HiRISE images, such as this one (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002545_1430_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 680 meters across; 2727 x 1723, 4 MB), show that the mantled unit is textured and full of boulders, which contrasts with the smooth appearance of this material in MOC images.

PSP_002574_1865	This image shows a ground surface composed of many thin lightñ and darkñtoned layers.<br><br>These layers are mostly parallel with adjacent layers, and sets of layers often form intricate curved shapes that are reminiscent of wood grain.<br><br>What we see here is actually a series of rock layers that have been sequentially laid down on the floor of a large impact crater. These layers create interesting geometric patterns because they initially accumulated as large ripples, or sand dunes.<br><br>Subsequently, the ground surface was eroded away by the wind, revealing these underground layers of bedrock.
PSP_002590_1765	This image shows a portion of the light-toned layered deposits in Juventae Chasma.<br><br>Juventae Chasma is a large trough just north of the main part of Valles Marineris, and may have been the source region for giant floods long ago. There are currently several large hills of layered rock on the chasma floor, likely remnants of a deposit which was once more extensive. Among the possible origins of the layered deposits are lake sediments, volcanic material of various origins (possibly erupted under ice), or deposits of aeolian sand and dust.<br><br>The <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002590_1765_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows some extremely thin beds</a> within one of the mounds (center; 2196x1442, 3MB). These are probably sheets of material lying nearly flat, and are some of the finest-scale layers observed on Mars. It is possible that in places layer boundaries are accentuated by variable amounts of dark wind-blown dust, which buries the layers in some parts of the image; nevertheless, some of the layering must be extremely thin.<br><br>The layers are actually even more thin than they appear, since the slope of the mound makes them appear wider. The occurrence of many thin layers indicates many events or variations in deposition while this material was forming. 
PSP_002620_1410	This image shows a portion of two impact craters on the floor of Newton Basin where a smaller crater formed within a earlier larger one. The larger crater's north rim can be seen diagonally (southwest-northeast) across the image and the smaller crater's north rim is near the bottom of the image.<br><br>Several gullies are incised along the interior wall of the larger crater. These gullies start near the top of the wall and can be traced across a break in slope partway down the wall (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002620_1410_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> 750 meters across; 3000 x 2000, 17 MB). This break in slope occurs along the entire portion of the crater wall, and appear shallower just above the break in slope, and deeper below the slope break. This suggests that the fluid which eroded and carved out the wall materials forming the gullies, increased in velocity after the slope break, creating a deeper section.
PSP_002622_0945	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>In a region of the south pole known informally as "Ithaca" numerous fans of dark frost form every spring. HiRISE collected a time lapse series of these images, starting at Ls = 185 and culminating at Ls = 294. "Ls" is the way we measure time on Mars: at Ls = 180 the sun passes the equator on its way south; at Ls = 270 it reaches its maximum subsolar latitude and summer begins. <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002622-002675_0945_cut_c.jpg'>In the earliest image</a> fans are dark, but small narrow bright streaks can be detected. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002622-002675_0945_cut_b.jpg'>In the next image,</a> acquired at Ls = 187, just 106 hours later, dramatic differences are apparent.  The dark fans are larger and the bright fans are more pronounced and easily detectable. The third image in the sequence shows no bright fans at all.  <br><br>We believe that the bright streaks are fine frost condensed from the gas exiting the vent. The conditions must be just right for the bright frost to condense.
PSP_002630_1695	This HiRISE image shows an outcrop of bright material in Melas Chasma, part of the giant Valles Marineris trough system.<br><br>These troughs contain many bright deposits, often layered. The origin of these materials is still not known, but is the subject of much study because answering this question will provide important information regarding the geologic history of Mars. <br><br>In this image, some layers can be seen, but much of the surface has a strange scalloped texture. The cause of this texture is unclear, but it is likely related to the mechanism of erosion of these deposits as well as their physical nature. <br><br>These materials are being eroded by winds, forming elongated ridges called yardangs. These winds may also be responsible for the small-scale scalloped texture. Also, landslides have produced some talus cones, composed of piles of loose debris; these are visible in places, mostly near the base of the mound, as wedge-shaped features containing many boulders.
PSP_002651_0930	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>The south polar terrain on Mars contains landforms unlike any that we see on Earth, so much that a new vocabulary is required to describe them. The word "araneiform" means "spider-like." There are radially organized channels on Mars that look spider-like, but we don't want to confuse anyone by talking about "spiders" when we really mean "channels," not "bugs."  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002651_0930_cut_b.jpg'>The first subimage</a> shows an example of "connected araneiform topography," terrain that is filled with spider-like channels whose arms branch and connect to each other. Gas flows through these channels until it encounters a vent, where it escapes out to the atmosphere, carrying dust along with it. The dark dust is blown around by the prevailing wind.   <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002651_0930_cut_b.jpg'>The second subimage</a> shows a different region of the same image where the channels are not radially organized.

PSP_002655_1280	This image shows part of a large mass of layered rock in Galle Crater, in the southern cratered highlands of Mars. <br><br>At low resolution, layers appear as bands and swirls which are nearly horizontal. This causes them to interact dramatically with topography, producing the appearance of folds and loops wrapping around small hills much like lines on a contour map. Zooming in at higher resolution, some long cracks (hundreds of meters long) are cutting across the layers, generally trending northeast-southwest. <br><br>At full resolution, details of the layers are often obscured by ripples of wind-blown dust or textured patterns of erosion now eroding the rock. In the best exposures, <a href='../2007/details/cut/PSP_002655_1280_cut_b.jpg'>such as that in the cutout section (2196x1442, 3 MB)</a>  the layers are fractured into blocks. Some of the layers are relatively resistant, and appear as ridges or fins in the cutout, often with little material supporting them from below. Although this seems to indicate relatively strong, coherent material, few boulders are visible. The ridge-forming layers may be weak, but separated by material with virtually no cohesion. <br><br>Polygonal fracture patterns in the dark regolith between distinct layers could be due to ground ice, or regional tectonic stresses.
PSP_002671_1790	This image is centered on a small cone on the side of one of Mars' giant shield volcanoes. The cone shows some layers of hard rock but most of it is made of relatively soft material.  This appears to be an example of a "cinder" cone composed of pieces of lava thrown into the air during a small volcanic eruption.<br><br>Typically, such eruptions produce fountains of molten lava.  Most of the lava would have cooled in this fountain, producing a loose pile of lava rocks.  However, it appears that some pulses of the eruption allowed the lava to land without cooling much. These pieces were hot enough to weld together to make the hard layers we see today.  The cone is 700 x 1100 m (2300 x 3600 feet) in size, similar to many cinder cones on Earth.  <br><br>In other parts of the image, we see channels carved by lava. It is sometimes difficult to tell if a channel was formed by flowing water or lava; in this case, it is possible to see that lava flows feed out of these channels.
PSP_002703_1920	This image of the floor of the Isidis Basin was taken in coordination with the Mars flyby of the European Rosetta mission. <br><br>Comparing this image with those taken by the OSIRIS camera onboard Rosetta should help calibrate HiRISE.  Since OSIRIS was only able to take low resolution images of Mars, this image was targetted at a broad, bland, expanse of uniform appearance. <br><br>However, it is just east of the landing ellipse for the failed European Beagle 2 lander and may help with the search for debris from that mission. This is an example of the international cooperation of HiRISE and the MRO missions.
PSP_002728_1645	This image shows dunes on the floor of Herschel Crater. The steep faces ("slipfaces") are oriented downwind, in the direction of motion of the dunes. One feature of particular interest is the dune-free area downwind of the crater at the image center. Some sand has been trapped in the crater, but the crater prevents the dunes from migrating directly downwind. <br><br>Sand dunes form naturally as a result of the transport of sand by the wind. The dunes in this image are somewhat crescent-shaped, but are being extended and distorted downwind and merging with nearby dunes; this complex behavior is common in dune fields on Earth.<br><br>In the southern part of the image the sand lies in sheets rather than well-defined dunes. At high resolution, the dune surfaces are covered in small ripples and scallops, also shaped by the wind.

PSP_002764_1800	Mars Global Surveyor imaged Mars from 1997-2006, and observed nineteen spots in dust-covered regions that darkened at various times, and that correspond to very recent-looking impact craters.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002764_1800_cut_b.jpg'>The craters are much smaller</a> than the dark spots; the darkening is thought to be due to an atmospheric blast or high winds associated with the event which removed or redistributed the bright dust (1600 x 1600; 2MB).<br><br>HiRISE has been re-imaging these locations, revealing many new details. In several locations the dark spots contain many dark streaks on topographic slopes. These dark streaks trend downhill, and the images reveal that a thin surface layer has been removed. These are interpreted as dust avalanches, which are common over dusty slopes of Mars.The dark streaks mark the most recent avalanches, which are often only a few years or decades old.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002764_1800_cut_b.jpg'>The craters are much smaller</a>Shown here in the dark region</a> is the densest concentration of dark streaks ever seen on Mars. Possibly these dust avalanches were triggered by the impact event, either from the atmospheric blast or from seismic shaking when the asteroid fragments struck the ground.
PSP_002804_0930	This image is taken in one of the troughs that are typical within the stack of Martian south polar layered deposits. <br><br>Viewed at low resolution, sequences of layers of different albedos, or brightnesses, and/or textures can be seen. At full resolution, the different tones and textures can be seen to be due to different shapes and sizes of polygonal fractures, surface knobiness, and surface cover and concentration of frost, often within polygonal fractures. <br><br>Faint criss-crossing troughs and dimples can be discerned on even the smoothest surfaces. Perhaps the most notable features in the image are the distinct round to heart-shaped to blob-shaped depressions scattered throughout the smooth areas, dubbed "swiss-cheese terrain." <br><br>The smooth material is solid carbon dioxide ice representing the uppermost layer of the south polar residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' north polar cap. The swiss-cheese depressions are areas in which sublimation of the carbon dioxide ice was initiated at a particular location and spread laterally from that point, creating rounded depressions typically several to 10 meters deep.<br><br>In HiRISE images, it is evident that this carbon dioxide-rich material is actually comprised of several individual horizontal layers. In this particular location, several images had been acquired over the previous decade by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) at slightly lower resolutions. In a series of those MOC images, the swiss-cheese depressions were seen to enlarge radially, or grow over a time period of several years. <br><br>Part of the HiRISE imaging campaign includes continued monitoring of these features (at higher resolution) to understand their growth rates and patterns. In turn, we can better comprehend the role of carbon dioxideóthe main component of the Mars atmosphereóin the current Mars climate regime.

PSP_002824_1355	Image PSP_002824_1355 shows a sand dune field in Rabe Crater. Rabe crater is approximately 100 km in diameter and is located in the southern highlands of Mars.<br><br>The dune field within the crater has dimensions of roughly 50 km x 35 km, making it one of the largest dune fields in the region. It is composed mostly of barchanoid and transverse dunes that formed from uni-directional winds from the southeast. The sand grains are believed to be basalt, a common volcanic rock, that eroded from sedimentary units (made of eroded lava) exposed in a pit on the floor of Rabe Crater. <br><br>The dark toned streaks seen on the dune slip face <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002824_1355_cut_b.jpg'>in the subimage</a> are believed to form from grain-flow events, or sand avalanches, that occur when wind carries sand grains over the crest of the dune and deposits them on the slip face oversteepening the slope. (1141x775; 2 MB). When compared with older images, the identification of new streaks in HiRISE images could indicate that these dunes are still active today. Also seen in the subimage are smaller secondary dunes superimposed on the surface of the large dunes.<br>
PSP_002828_1700	This image is from a region along the walls of southwestern Melas Chasma that contains extensive valley networks and layered beds.<br><br>Some have proposed that the layered beds formed in a former lake that resulted from runoff of the valley networks to the west. The layered beds are thought to be sediments carried and subsequently deposited in a lake that may have once existed along this flat-lying basin. <br><br>The color image covers some of the layered beds as well as the wallrock to the north and south. There are color differences seen between some of the layered units, such as those <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002828_1700_cut_b.jpg'>visible in the subimage</a>; a lighter-toned unit that is stratigraphically below the darker-toned unit can be seen to the right. Yellow hills are visible towards the bottom.<br><br>These color variations appear to be associated with compositional differences between the units, which are different layers within the basin. These compositional differences could reflect variations in the material that was deposited by the valley networks, or they could be the result of evaporative sequences that occurred as the lake drained or first froze then sublimated away (changed state directly from a solid to a gas). <br><br>The dark circular features likely represent eroded impact craters that have more recently been filled in by dark debris, such as basalt sand, that in some instances forms ripples.<br><br>Note: the color in these images is enhanced; it is not as it would normally appear to the human eye.

PSP_002839_1825	Aram Chaos appears to be a former impact crater. The terrain is disrupted, giving it a chaotic appearance (hence the name "chaos"). Scientists have postulated that a lake may have once existed inside the crater and sediments were laid down within the lake. <br><br>The mineral hematite (rich in iron) has been detected by orbiting spacecraft within Aram Chaos. Hematite has been identified in several other locations on Mars, including at the Mars Exploration Rover landing site in Meridiani Planum. The hematite at both Meridiani and Aram Chaos most likely formed by precipitation in water. <br><br>This HiRISE image shows the light-toned sediments inside Aram Chaos that could have formed in a former lake. Unfortunately, dark debris now obscures much of this sediment, making it difficult to view and interpret the rocks. The light-toned layered deposit in the south (bottom) of the image is higher standing and has a pitted surface.<br><br>Circular structures with dark centers are likely to be impact craters that have been partly filled with dark debris, including sand. More irregular depressions appear to result from erosion of layered beds within the sediments. Wind could erode materials that are slightly weaker more quickly and produce the irregular topography seen along the surface of the deposit.
PSP_002840_1855	PSP_002840_1855 shows a portion of Nanedi Valles, an equatorial Martian valley network. <br><br>Valley networks are thought to have formed by groundwater sapping either in conjunction with an ice layer to cover the running water or during a past warmer, wetter climate regime on Mars.  Glacial activity has also been proposed to form the valley networks.<br><br>Groundwater sapping is the leading theory because of the morphology of the valleys. They commonly have approximately constant width along their reaches, as seen here, as well as theater shaped heads, as seen in the tributary valley in the bottom right of the scene. The meandering nature of valleys suggests persistent or repeated flow as required to form meanders in streams on Earth. <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002840_1855_cut_b.jpg'>subimage </a> (approximately 1.1 km across; 6.4 MB) shows a potential remnant channel seen on the floor of Nanedi Valles just below the center of the image.  If this is a remnant channel, it suggests that there was either repeated or waning flows in this valley. Winding dunes and abundant impact craters are found throughout the valley, as well as within this putative channel. <br><br>Dunes are thought to be transient features on Mars, although no movement has been detected to date. It is interesting to note that some of the dunes are superposed by craters indicating that the dunes were stable long enough for craters to form and not be erased. <br><br>It is possible that the craters on top of the dunes are secondary craters that formed as a product of a larger impact. Secondary craters from a single impact are clustered in space and form almost simultaneously, implying that the dunes were stable for a time periodólong enough for a single crater, rather than multiple craters, to form.
PSP_002856_0875	This image shows a variety of surface textures within the south polar residual cap of Mars.<br><br>It was taken during the southern spring, when the surface was covered by seasonal carbon dioxide frost, so that surface relief is easily seen.  Illumination is from the bottom left, highlighting long troughs at to the right and round pits and irregular mesas to the left of center.<br><br>These unique landforms are common in the south polar residual cap, which is known from previous Mars Global Surveyor images to be eroding rapidly in places. Right of center, polar layered deposits are exposed on a sun-facing scarp. These deposits are older than the residual ice cap, and the layers are thought to record climate variations on Mars similar to ice ages on Earth.
PSP_002860_1650	HiRISE image PSP_002860_1650 shows part of the floor of Herschel Crater, a roughly 300 kilometer wide impact basin located in the southern cratered highlands of Mars. <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002860_1650_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage is a close-up</a> of a dark-toned sand dune field located on the crater floor. These dunes are "barchan" dunes, which are also commonly found on Earth. Barchan dunes are generally crescent-shaped, with their "horns" oriented in the downwind direction. They have a steep slip face (the downwind side of the dune).<br><br>Barchan dunes form by winds that blow mostly in one direction and thus are good indicators of the dominant wind direction. In this case, the strongest winds blow approximately north to south. <br><br>The surface of the dunes has a generally pitted and grooved texture and, in some places, is covered with smaller ripples. The grooved texture has led researchers in the past to believe the dune sands are "lithified," or cemented together.  The rock that formed as a result has since been eroded and scoured by wind. <br><br>These dark dunes in Herschel Crater are most likely composed of basaltic sand.
PSP_002882_0940	<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002882_0940_cut_b.jpg'>This subimage,</a> about 2.5 km across, shows the south polar layered deposits exposed in a scarp illuminated from the lower right. (Please note: this subimage is 8349x8400 pixels; 66 MB.)<br><br>This image was taken in the southern spring, when the surface was completely covered by carbon dioxide frost. Therefore, most of the brightness variations in this scene are caused by topography. <br><br>The polar layered deposits are broken into blocks by fractures in two directions. Neither set of fractures is parallel to the current scarp face, suggesting that they were not formed as the scarp was eroded, but instead are due to pre-existing weaknesses in the polar layered deposits.  <br><br>The four craters at lower left appear to have formed at the same time by an impactor that broke up as it entered the Martian atmosphere. The presence of many craters such as these on the south polar layered deposits indicates that they are not as young as the north polar layered deposits, which have very few craters on them. 
PSP_002884_1395	This observation shows gullies in a southern hemisphere crater, whose floor has large mounds of material that are likely slump blocks that fell off the crater walls during a late stage of formation. There are also a large number of dunes of different sizes and facing different directions on the crater floor. <br><br>The gullies seen in this image formed over a period of time. The majority of them have experienced modification since they formed. This can be seen in the form of polygonal fractures on their walls, dunes or ripples on their channel floors, and rocks and material fallen from their walls (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002884_1395_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 625 meters across; 2500 x 2000; 5 MB). Some of the gullies facing east were active more recently. They do not have polygonal fractures or they have fractures that are less well-developed. A narrow, primarily unmodified channel is also visible.<br><br>It is unknown over what period of time gullies formed in individual settings and globally. It is possible that gully formation continues today.
PSP_002892_1760	This HiRISE image shows an outcrop of a large slab of layered deposits in Aureum Chaos.<br><br>"Chaotic" terrains on Mars are disorganized regions of blocks and large mounds which appear to have been produced by the collapse of pre-existing terrain. They are often associated with giant outflow channels, and they may have been the source of the water that carved the channels. This link is an important part of understanding the history of water on Mars. One way to address this is to study the rocks left behind in the chaotic terrains. <br><br>The outcrop in this image is several kilometers across and light-toned. It has a slab-like appearance, with relatively steep edges and a flat top, although the top has many small knobs and spires. In places, particularly along the west (left) edge of the main slab, it is clear that the light material is composed of many fine layers, which are eroding in a stepped fashion due to the variable resistance of the layers. The flat surface of the outcrop is partially coated with dark dust, obscuring its light tone.<br><br>Along the edges, the outcrop is breaking into boulders and eroding away, but it is strong enough that it preserves steep slopes, particularly on the eastern edge. <br><br>Away from the large slab, the image consists of hills and mounds characteristic of chaotic terrain. Little detail is visible on the mounds. The low areas have been partially covered by wind-blown sand or dust, forming the pervasive ripples seen in the image. Light material can be seen under the ripples in a few places, indicating that the light layered deposits extend farther than just the slab. 
PSP_002909_2000	Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System is covered by lava flows. Most of these lava flows carried the liquid lava in open streams which geologists call channels. In some places these channels break down and the lava spreads across a broad area, like a fan. In the center of this HiRISE image, you can see the transition from well-confined lava channels into broad fans as the lava flowed down to the north.  <br><br>When viewed at full-resolution, the HiRISE image shows a fuzzy pitted surface. This is caused by a thick layer of very small particles that are being moved around by the wind. It is not clear at this point in time whether these particles are predominantly dust deposited from the global dust storms or if they are mostly volcanic ash.
PSP_002917_2175	A northern mid-latitude scene consisting of craters, intercrater plains, and mantled material is visible in this HiRISE image.  <br><br>The mantled material seen here covers much of the middle latitudes in both hemispheres of Mars; it has been visibly removed in some locations. It's called "mantled" because it looks as if it's just draped over, or mantling, the topography underneath.<br><br>The mantled material is what causes the craters to have a muted, softened appearance. It's thought to be ice-rich material deposited in a climate different from that of today.  <br><br>The mantled unit is dissected here, meaning that is not pristine and has likely undergone modification since it was originally laid down.  The intercrater plains have a pitted texture (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002917_2175_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage; full resolution, approximately 200 meters, or 218 yards; 1131x1011, 3MB)</a> thought to be caused by water ice sublimating and leaving depressions behind.<br><br>Unlike that of Earth, the obliquity (tilt of the planet's rotation axis) of Mars changes wildly.  Earth has the Moon to keep its axis stable, but Mars' satellites, Phobos and Deimos, are not massive enough to do the same.<br><br>Today Mars' obliquity (25.19 degrees) is similar to that of Earth's (23.45 degrees), but this has not always been the case.  As the obliquity changes, the portions of Mars that receive the most sunlight shift. During periods of high obliquity, polar regions receive the most sunlight. This causes polar ices, including water ice and carbon dioxide ice, to sublimate (evaporate) into the atmosphere. They would then potentially be re-deposited in the mid-latitudes, similar to where this image is located. It is believed that this process is responsible for the mid-latitude mantled unit.<br>

PSP_002922_1725	PSP_002922_1725 shows glacier-like flow in a depression in the flanks of Arsia Mons.<br><br>Arsia Mons is one of the large Martian volcanoes that sits near the equator on the Tharsis Rise.  Downslope is towards the top left of the image, and flow is in this direction.<br><br>It is interesting to note that the depression being viewed is not directly radial from the volcano's peak, but rather oriented approximately 45 degrees away from radial, along the flanks of the volcano.<br><br>The pitted texture of the material suggests that sublimation is occurring or has occurred.  Sublimation is when a substance, such as water ice, goes directly from a solid state to a gaseous state without going through an intermediate liquid phase. The surface temperature and pressure on Mars are such that water in ice-rich material can easily sublimate leaving behind a depression where the volatiles were removed.<br><br>It is possible that the flow features in this image are relict glaciers. The flow lobes and surface lineations are similar to those found on glaciers on Earth. The merging of the lobes seen in the bottom of the image <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002922_1725_cut_b.jpg'>and the subimage</a> (approximately 3.2 km across) implies that multiple walls are shedding material.<br><br>It's possible that the flanks of Arsia Mons contain ice-rich material possibly deposited during a different obliquity (tilt of Mars' spin axis) or climate regime.
PSP_002932_1445	This observation shows the southern latitude crater Hale, a rather large, pristine elliptical crater approximately ~125 x 150 km in diameter.  Hale Crater possesses sharp features, impact melt bodies ponded through out the structure and few overprinting impact craters. These attributes indicate that it is relatively young and certainly well-preserved -- likely the youngest crater of this size on Mars!<br><br>Present on the crater walls are a large number of gullies, some with light-toned deposits. The gullies seen here are very well developed, and many are cut deeply into the crater walls. Several have braided channels suggestive of repeated flow. Some of the gullies have boulders littered throughout their channels.  This could be a result of a fluid preferentially transporting smaller particles and leaving larger rubble behind. The composition of the light-toned deposits are currently unknown. The CRISM visible-infrared spectrometer, HiRISE's sister instrument on MRO, may be able to shed some light on the composition of these materials.<br><br>In one place along the crater rim (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002932_1445_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 1 kilometer across; 3995 x 3420; 13 MB) gullies are visible on both sides of the rim. This has only been seen in a few locations on Mars.

PSP_002946_1765	PSP_002946_1765 shows a portion of interior layered deposits (ILD) in Juventae Chasma.<br><br>Juventae Chasma is a large depression near the equatorial canyon system Valles Marineris. The scene is along the top of a mound of layered deposits on the floor of Juventae Chasma. Dunes are seen in the low-lying, darker regions. Very fine layers are also seen (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002946_1765_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 1 km across).  Understanding what kinds of materials formed the layers, how they were set in place, and how they have evolved will provide insight into Martian geologic history.<br><br>Many of the Martian chasmata (plural of chasma) contain ILD like these. The ILD were deposited a long time ago, but the actual method is unknown.  It has been suggested that sedimentary layers in standing bodies of water or volcanic ash deposits comprise the ILD. The alternating layers could indicate regular, repeating cycles of deposition.  It is possible that these layers once covered the entire chasma floor.  <br><br>The IDL shown here have been modified by wind erosion. The yardangs seen near the top right of the image are evidence for wind sculpting of the deposits. It is interesting to note that there are very few craters in this scene, especially in the areas with visible layers. One crater can be found about half-way down the left side of the image amidst layers, and several craters are seen in the dark material on the right side of the image. This suggests that the ILD are eroding here fast enough to erase small craters before large numbers of them can accumulate.

PSP_003077_1530	Scientists on the HiRISE team have discovered never-before-seen impact ìmegabrecciaî and a possibly once-habitable ancient lake on Mars at a place called Holden crater.<br><br>The megabreccia is topped by layers of fine sediments that formed in what apparently was a long-lived, calm lake that filled Holden crater on early Mars, HiRISE scientists say.<br><br>ìHolden crater has some of the best-exposed lake deposits and ancient megabreccia known on Mars," said HiRISEís principal investigator, professor Alfred McEwen of the UAís <a href='http://www.lpl.arizona.edu'><strong>Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.</strong></a> îBoth contain minerals that formed in the presence of water and mark potentially habitable environments. This would be an excellent place to send a rover or sample-return mission to make major advances in understanding if Mars supported life.ì<br><br>Holden crater is an impact crater that formed within an older, multi-ringed impact basin called Holden basin. Before an impact created Holden crater, large channels crossed and deposited sediments in Holden basin.<br><br>Blocks as big as 50 meters across were blasted from Holden basin when Holden crater formed, then fell chaotically back to the surface and eventually formed ìmegabreccia,î a conglomeration of large, broken boulders mixed with smaller particles. HiRISE images show megabreccia outcrops in Holden crater walls. This megabreccia may be some of the oldest deposits exposed on the surface of Mars.<br><br>At least 5 percent, by weight, of the fine sediments in the layer on top of the megabreccia consists of clay, according to another instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, or CRISM.<br><br>ìThe origin of the clays is uncertain, but clays in the probable lake sediments implies quiescent conditions that may preserve signatures of a past habitable environment,î HiRISE co-investigator John Grant of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum said. ìIf we were looking on Earth for an environment that preserves signatures related to habitability, this is one of the kinds of environments we would look at.î<br><br>And even the clay-containing layers arenít all thatís icing the cake. Topping the clay layers that formed in the placid Holden crater lake are layers of great boulder-filled debris unleashed later, when water breached Holden crater rim, creating a torrential flood that eroded the older lake sediments.<br><br>The clay-rich layers would have remained buried from view, except for that great piece of luck, the fact that Holden crater rim could no longer withstand the force of an estimated 4,000 cubic kilometers of water dammed behind it. The body of water would have been larger than Lake Huron.<br><br>ìThe volume of water that poured through during this flood must have been spectacular,î Grant said. ìIt ripped up finely bedded materials, including blocks 70 meters or 80 meters across --  blocks nearly the size of football fields.î<br><br>The first, prolonged watery episode at Holden crater that settled out the fine-grain sediments probably lasted at least thousands of years. By contrast, the second lake, formed when the crater rim was breached, may have lasted only hundreds of years, not long at all, Grant said.<br><br>The megabreccia excavated when Holden crater formed is the first found on Mars, Grant said. ìWhen large craters form, they produce very large blocks of material. We see them on Earth. Popigai Crater in Russia is one example. But we'd never seen them on Mars, and we knew they ought to be there. Now weíve seen them with HiRISE.î<br><br>The observations suggest that the clays originally could have formed before the impact created Holden crater in the older Holden basin. Many of the blocks in the megabreccia appear to erode more easily than the surrounding crater wall material. These blocks could be chunks of Holden basin sediments that predate the impact crater, Grant said. "These blocks could be derived from the earlier Holden basin that were excavated on impact, then later re-eroded, with the sediments settling to the bottom of the long-lived lake. It's intriguing to think the clays we see in Holden crater now might actually have been recycled."<br><br>Holden crater is one of six remaining landing site candidates for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, a mission scheduled for launch next year.<br><br>So far, most evidence for sustained wet conditions on Mars is limited to the planet's earliest history, the HiRISE scientists say. While water certainly flowed over the planet later in its history, it may have flowed only in short-lived, or catastrophic events.<br><br>Grant is first author on a research paper about Holden crater, published in the journal ìGeologyî last week.

Avalanching or mass movement of sand has left deep scars on the slip face of the large dune in the upper left portion of the subimage. This may indicate that the sand is not loose but is weakly cemented.
PSP_003162_1445	This observation shows an approximately 6 kilometer diameter crater with gullies and interesting crater fill.<br><br>The crater fill may have formed from mass wasting (downward movement of material due to gravity) of ice-rich material. It is  distinct from the walls of the crater, which is unusual. Often crater fill will take the form of concentric circles, suggesting that material has been transported down each wall similarly. This is not the case here.<br><br>There are two main sets of gullies, one deeply incised (left) next to one that is shallower (right). The gullies on the left are well developed and have likely experienced more flow than the gullies on the right. The well-developed gullies cross several wrinkles that wrap around much of the crater fill, indicating the gullies formed after the crater fill was in place. The gullies on the right (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003162_1445_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, approximately 750 meters across; 3000 x 2000, 6 MB) are shallow and narrow. Several have linear depressions above their sources suggesting that subsurface water flowing to the gully heads removed some material creating the collapse depressions seen here.
PSP_003176_1745	This observation shows a portion of the Gale Crater floor. Gale Crater is approximately 150 kilometers in diameter, located in Elysium Planitia, sitting near the dichotomy boundary between the Martian southern highlands and northern lowlands.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003176_1745_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows</a> several light-toned layers (952 x 955; 1 MB). The origin of the sediments composing the layers is unknown and could have included deposition in an ancient flood or lake or the deposition of windblown particles such as dust or volcanic ash. The relatively uniform character of the layers and the manner of erosion suggests that the sediments are fine-grained. <br><br>The paucity of impact craters indicates that the layered deposits are either very young or that erosion has removed evidence of past cratering. Wind erosion, in particular, has modified the layers creating relatively sharp edges and rounded depressions. In general, the fact that layers are found on isolated mounds indicates that some process has eroded an originally more extensive, layered deposit. Large dunes are also visible in the lower portion of the subimage.
PSP_003179_0945	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>There is an enigmatic region near the south pole of Mars known as the "cryptic" terrain. It stays cold in the spring, even as its albedo darkens and the sun rises in the sky.<br><br>This region is covered by a layer of translucent seasonal carbon dioxide ice that warms and evaporates from below. As carbon dioxide gas escapes from below the slab of seasonal ice it scours dust from the surface. The gas vents to the surface, where the dust is carried downwind by the prevailing wind.<br><br>The channels carved by the escaping gas are often <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003179_0945_cut_b.jpg'>radially organized and are known informally as "spiders."</a>
PSP_003180_0945	During the long dark night of Martian winter at the South Pole, carbon dioxide in its solid form (also known as "dry ice") accumulates and forms a seasonal polar cap.<br><br>HiRISE is currently observing southern spring on Mars. As the sun comes up in the spring, the ice evaporates in a complex way.  This observation shows dark dust being blown across the seasonal south polar cap. The dust comes from the surface beneath the ice: it either starts at spots bare of ice, or it's possible that it's lofted from below the ice in geyser-like plumes.<br><br>Local winds blow the dust from its source, forming a long fan. When the wind changes direction, a new fan is formed, pointing in the new direction (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003180_0945_cut_b2.jpg'>see subimage 2; full resolution, approx. 800 meters, or 1/2 mile across; 1451x953, 4MB).</a> In this single image we can see that the wind has blown in a number of directions (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003180_0945_cut_b1.jpg'>see subimage 1; not full resolution, approximately 4 kilometers, or 2.5 miles,  across; 1012x815, 2MB).</a> This data will be used to study weather patterns near the South Pole.<br>
PSP_003193_0850	Southern spring sunshine is causing the seasonal carbon dioxide cap at the south pole to evaporate. This process happens fitfully, as small and large spots expose bare ground, which warms up, causing small spots to grow.<br><br>The defrosting areas are controlled by small scale differences in topography, which cause some areas of frost to be sheltered longer than others. Once dust has accessed the surface it is blown in directions controlled by the local winds, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003193_0850_cut_b.jpg'>making a distinctive fan.</a> When the wind changes direction the fans broaden or may show multiple orientations.<br><br>It has also been proposed that dust is carried to the top of translucent seasonal carbon dioxide ice by release of gas held under pressure by the ice cap. When the pressure is released, like pulling the cork out of a champagne bottle, the gas escapes, carrying dust with it.

PSP_003223_1755	This image shows several long, sinuous features on the plains near Juventae Chasma. These features have been explained as former stream channels now preserved in inverted relief. <br><br>Inverted relief occurs when a formerly low-lying area becomes high-standing. For instance, depressions may become filled with lava that is more resistant to erosion. In the case of stream channels, there are several possible reasons why the channel might stand out in inverted relief. The streambed may contain larger rocks, which remain while fine material is blown away by the wind, or it could be cemented by some chemical precipitating from flowing water. <br><br>These features are old, since several impact craters cut the ridges. They provide important information about past processes on Mars. Understanding how streams could have formed is an important issue in understanding the history of water on Mars.

PSP_003231_2095	This image covers a region of science interest to which the Mars Science Laboratory rover might drive and explore.<br><br>The rover would need to first land in a nearby area that is flatter and less rocky so the chances of surviving the landing are high, but an acceptable landing site might be too far away to count on reaching these mesas.<br><br>Phyllosilicate (clay) minerals have been detected in this region by imaging spectrometers on the Mars Express and MRO spacecraft, and these minerals are of great interest  in the search for evidence of life on ancient Mars.<br><br>Some day the capability may exist for precision landing and hazard avoidance, so a rover could be set down right next to rocky outcrops of interest for study, and perhaps collecting rock samples for return to Earth. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003231_2095_cut_b.jpg'>subimage illustrates some of these rocky mesas.</a> It would take a person about 30 minutes to hike across this 1.1 kilometer wide area.

PSP_003239_1870	Image PSP_003239_1870 reveals slope streaks in an area south of Olympus Mons in the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>These features are found along the slopes of impact craters, buttes, knobs, ridges, and troughs on Mars. Streaks generally start at a point source and widen downslope, traveling over and sometimes around various obstacles.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003239_1870_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows a very wide dark slope</a> that has developed small fingers at its termius. The dark slope streak does not appear to have relief and does not disturb the pre-existing surface leaving the underlying topography intact beneath its dark trail. This can be seen particularly well near the streak termination. There are also no observable deposits of displaced materials along the terminus. <br><br>Surrounding the dark slope streak are multiple ~1 meter deep, triangular faceted scars left behind from avalanched slope materials. The high standing remnant surfaces on either side of the lower scarred surface are clearly visible. Avalanche scars are sometimes found in areas where slope streaks have formed but they are believed to be unrelated. The trail of the dark slope streak appears to cross over the avalanche scars suggesting that the slope streak formed more recently.<br><br>Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. While their mechanism of formation and triggering is debated, they are most commonly believed to form by downslope movement of extremely dry sand or very fine-grained dust in an almost fluidlike manner (analogous to a terrestrial snow avalanche) exposing darker underlying material. <br><br>Other ideas include the triggering of slope streak formation by possible concentrations of near-surface ice or scouring of the surface by running water from aquifers intercepting slope faces, briny liquid flows, dry granular flow, mixed water-dust flows, and/or hydrothermal activity.
PSP_003249_1510	This HiRISE image shows eroding layered deposits in Ritchey Crater, a large impact crater in the southern highlands. <br><br>Three general units can be seen: a relatively dark upper layer, a light middle unit, and the floor material, which may be mostly obscured by dust. The dark cap layer appears to be relatively hard and resistant, while the light material is weak. Once the upper layer is removed, the light layer does not last long. <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003249_1510_cut_b.jpg'>cutout from the top center part of the image</a> shows this stack (2196x1442; 3 MB). The dark unit is thin and breaking into boulders. The light material is actually divided into smaller layers, and is pervasively fractured. However, the boulders falling from the edge are mostly small and rarely remain intact if they move more than a few meters. The cracking of the layer could be due to water loss from the layer, or to regional tectonic effects such as stresses from burial and erosion. The base unit is partially covered by wind-blown ripples. <br><br>It is unclear how each of these layers formed. Volcanic ash layers, lake or stream deposits, or sandstone deposited by dunes can all produce horizontal layers. Unraveling the origin would provide important clues to Mars' past.
PSP_003252_1425	This HiRISE image shows a bright gully deposit and other gullies within a crater wall in Terra Sirenum (37.7 degrees south, 229.0 degrees east). <br><br>Three images are available: A) The full frame HiRISE image, with the crater at left center; the width of the image is 6 km; B) <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003252_1425_cut_b1.jpg'>enlargement showing the crater</a> (895 x 1296; 3MB); and C) a <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003252_1425_cut_b2.jpg'>close-up of the bright gully deposit</a> (1120 x 809; 884KB). Frames B and C have been stretched to enhance contrast. The red box in B shows the location of C.  <br><br>As seen in A and B, the appearance of the crater wall differs between the northern and southern sides. On the northern  pole-facing side walls, prominent gullies with channels and aprons are apparent, with many of these having valley-like alcoves near their tops. The morphology of the gullies is consistent with formation by a fluid, most likely water. On the pole-facing slopes, ground ice or aquifers may be more stable, being subjected to less heating from sunlight compared to equator-facing slopes. In contrast, the southern, equator-facing walls are dominated by rocky debris flows that lack prominent channels. <br><br>The bright gully deposit has a very fluid-like appearance, and has not been covered by other gullies or debris flows, indicating a young age. The brightness is a mystery; it could be due to minerals formed from water or ice. Alternatively, the flow that made the gully may have removed a thin coating of relatively darker dust and soil, revealing a brighter substrate. In any case, this feature is probably indicative of recent flow of water or water-rich material on Mars.
PSP_003253_1880	This image shows a pedestal crater located in a geologic unit on Mars called the Medusa Fossae Formation.<br><br>Pedestal craters are produced by differential erosion around impact craters. If the ejecta (material thrown out of the crater) is more resistant to erosion, then the crater and surrounding ejecta will be preserved while the surface is eroded nearby. This causes the ejecta blanket surrounding the crater to form a "pedestal," standing out in relief rather than gradually merging into its surroundings. <br><br>There appear to be at least two resistant layers in the material around this pedestal crater, as there are two "steps" in the topography of the pedestal. <a href='../2007/details/cut/PSP_003253_1880_cut_b.jpg'>The cutout (2196x1442, 3 MB),</a> from the long ridge near the top center of the image, shows these steps as well as possible smaller-scale layering. <br><br>Despite the detail resolved by HiRISE, it is not clear why the step-forming layers are more resistant. Much of the scene is coated with a mantle of dust which obscures details. Dark slope streaks, likely produced by small avalanches in the dust, are common here. Dust deposition and erosion are also likely the reason for the scalloped texture of mantling material in the crater. 
PSP_003259_1850	This image shows some dark slope streaks where small impact craters are visible at their apexes. These craters have little splashes of dark ejecta, which indicate that they were throwing up the same dark-toned material that the slope streak has revealed.<br><br>These dark slope streaks and the medium-toned one <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_003200_003299/PSP_003259_1850/PSP_003259_1850_RED.abrowse.jpg'>to the left</a> show longitudinal ridges that are indicators of the flow of material during the slope streak event. Older, almost completely faded slope streaks can be seen to source off of the crater in the upper right corner of this portion of the image.

PSP_003269_1600	HiRISE image PSP_003269_1600 covers an alluvial fan along the wall of a large crater in the mid latitudes of the southern hemisphere of Mars. <br><br>The fan was formed when water and sediments drained down the steep wall of the crater creating a cone-shaped pile of debris at the base. As the fan grew with time, the channels carrying water and sediment across the fan surface changed locations, producing a layered deposit capped by channels radiating from the fan apex along the crater wall.<br><br>Subsequent stripping of the fan surface by the wind has left the coarser channel deposits in relief and exposed the fine scale layering within the fan in many locations. While is it is not known whether the source of the water responsible for creating the fan was related runoff from precipitation or groundwater or perhaps both, alluvial fans of broadly similar form are observed in many locations on Earth and are usually formed by runoff from precipitation.
PSP_003273_1675	PSP_003273_1675 shows part of Evros Vallis, one of the Martian valley networks.<br><br>These more ancient valley networks may have been eroded by flowing water during a warmer, wetter period of Martian history. Many dunes are visibile along the valley floor, as well as throughout the scene and in a partially exhumed crater on the valley wall. There are multiple generations and orientations of dunes. Dune orientation reflects the dominant  or prevailing wind direction. Multiple dune orientations indicate that this region has experienced different wind regimes.<br><br>An exhumed crater is one that likely formed a long time ago, was buried, and is now being re-exposed because the materials that originally covered it are being eroded away. The prominent crater on the valley wall as well as several other craters in this scene are thought to be partially exhumed.<br><br>The <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003273_1675_cut_b.jpg'>subimage (approximately 300 m across; 2433x2000 pixels, 5 MB)</a> shows a couple groups of secondary craters.  Secondary craters are craters that form when ejecta from the primary crater hits the surface with enough energy to form another smaller crater. As seen in the subimage, secondary craters often form in clusters spatially, because ejecta thrown out of the primary crater impacts the surface near each other at approximately the same time. <br><br>Many  potential secondary craters have have similar morphologies and have distinct, bright ejecta. This implies that these craters are relatively young and that their ejecta have yet to be covered by dust. 
PSP_003312_2145	HiRISE image PSP_003312_2145 reveals valleys that cross the ejecta from the large impact crater Cerulli to the south.<br><br>The valleys appear to have been cut by flowing water and then buried by later deposits of unknown origin, possibly carried in by the wind. While it is clear that the valleys are younger than the ejecta and older than at least some of the mantling materials, the exact time they were formed is uncertain.<br><br>For example, it is possible that the valleys were carved immediately after Cerulli crater formed, as has been inferred for some other valleys around craters imaged elsewhere on Mars by HiRISE. Alternatively, the valleys may have formed some time after the crater formed, perhaps as a result of water released from an earlier mantling deposit. <br><br>A second image is planned for this area and will yield three-dimensional information from stereo that may help to resolve the timing and source of water responsible for carving the valleys.

PSP_003331_2005	Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System is a shield volcano built up by lava flow after lava flow. Like the larger shield volcanoes Mauna Loa and Etna on Earth, many of these lava flows carried the liquid lava in open channels.<br><br>In some places these channels break down and the lava spills out, forming a broad fan. In the center of this HiRISE image, you can see a lava channel that has fed many overflows to both sides. The lava was traveling from the southeast toward the north and northwest.  <br><br>When viewed at full-resolution, the HiRISE image shows a very irregular surface. This is caused by a thick layer of very small particles that are being moved around by the wind. The linear features that could be mistaken for dunes in lower resolution images turn out to look more like wind-eroded ridges, called "yardangs" by geologists.
PSP_003359_1650	PSP_003359_1650 shows the south rim of an impact crater in Memnonia, a crater breached by valleys on its north and south ends (not seen here) and has terraces. Terraces are different levels up and down a crater wall that appear stair-like. The valleys and terraces suggest that this crater might have had a lake at one point in its history.<br><br>This HiRISE image shows a heavily cratered surface. The crater floor (top of the scene) is covered in craters and dunes indicating that its surface has been exposed for a long period of time. The crater wall (approximately center) also has abundant craters. Many of the craters are very small and found in clusters (for an example, look just down and below the largest crater near the center of the image). These are likely secondary craters--craters that are formed by ejecta that are a result of a separate, larger impact event.<br><br>What is particularly interesting about these craters is that many of them are surrounded by bright material (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003359_1650_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 750 meters across; 3000 x 2500; 7 MB). When a crater forms, an object hits the surface and throws out a lot of underlying material. It is possible that the bright material around the craters represents material that was excavated during the impact events. The bright material looks raised around several of the craters, suggesting that it is cemented and therefore more resistant to erosion by wind. The material could be bright because of its particle sizes or composition.
PSP_003364_0945	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>Every year seasonal carbon dioxide ice, known to us as "dry ice," covers the poles of Mars.

PSP_003370_2140	This image shows several pits along the floor of Cyane Fossae, a set of fissures between the giant volcanoes of Olympus Mons and Alba Patera (northeast of Olympus Mons). <br><br>The fissures probably  formed when the surface of the planet was actively being "stretched" from the stresses of volcanic activity, causing the surface to split open along faults. There is no material piled up around the edges of the pits, as would be expected if these were impact craters or volcanic vents. Instead, parts of the Fossae floor likely collapsed into the void underlying Cyane Fossae, forming the pits. This type of process, in which the crust is split open, has occurred here on Earth, and it created the geologic "basin and range" province of the western United States. <br><br>The walls of the pits are likely covered in dust and the few dark streaks along the walls are likely formed by avalanches of dust. Striations along the slope may be produced by the passage of dust devils. Dust also appears on the floors of the collapse pits and covered most of the plains nearby. Despite the presence of this layer of dust, bouldery outcrops occur in places along the wall, suggesting that the underlying material is hard and rocky.   
PSP_003379_1835	This HiRISE image is along the rim of an impact crater in Meridiani and shows a lighter-toned base unit with more resistant dark-toned ridges on top.<br><br>Both units exhibit complex fracture patterns. Also evident are old dune fields that have been solidified and then fractured, as well as younger, non-solidified dune fields.<br><br>More recently, the entire area has been deeply eroded by the wind.
PSP_003388_1590	This image shows a prominent "wrinkle" ridge in Hesperia Planum, northwest of the Hellas basin and adjacent to Tyrrhena Patera. <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are linear to arcuate positive relief features with a broad arch topped by a crenulated ridge. These features have been identified on many planets such as the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Venus. On Mars, they are many tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and up to several hundred meters high. Wrinkle ridges are believed to have formed by horizontal compression or shortening of the crust from faulting.<br><br>Locations of wrinkle ridges and faulted surfaces on Mars may be possible sites for paleo-spring formation where fluid along these faults may have leaked out. The area alongside such faults on Earth have a "bleached" appearance where salts have precipitated onto the surface as the water-soaked surface dried out over time. Such examples of fault-related fluid flow have been found in places on Earth, and possibly on Mars (see "Fracture-Controlled Paleo-Fluid Flow in Candor Chasma, Mars", Science, v. 315, 2007).
PSP_003392_1825	This HiRISE image shows the contact between two geologic units: a cratered plains unit and an etched terrain unit.<br><br>The cratered plains are relatively smooth and dark, while the brighter etched terrain consists of smooth plains and dune fields.<br><br>The etched terrain occupies the lowest portions of a ~120 kilometer NW-SE trending valley with a wide variety of landforms suggestive of wind erosion. Both units partially cover the ejecta from a ~20 kilometer crater directly to the northeast of the image.
PSP_003398_1910	This HiRISE images allows us to see this unusual geologic feature <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003398_1910_cut_b.jpg'>in three dimensions</a> (2000 x 2000; 11MB).<br><br>The sequence of events that formed this scene in the equatorial lowlands of Mars are as follows.  First, a meteorite impact excavated the 2.2 kilometer (1.4 mile) diameter crater in the center of the picture. Second, the area was flooded by a vast lava flow. However, the lava was not able to overtop the rim of the crater and it remained a large depression.<br><br>Third, the area was blanketed by a series of layers of small particles carried by the wind. This deposit makes up what is called the Medusae Fossae Formation and may be composed of volcanic ash. Finally, the Medusae Fossae Formation was largely eroded away by the wind. However, the deposits within the crater were protected from the wind and have remained to this day. <br><br>The hills outside the crater are also remnants of the Medusae Fossae Formation.

PSP_003426_2035	Elysium Mons is a large shield volcano on the opposite side of Mars from Olympus Mons and the other giant Tharsis volcanoes.  Like its siblings in Tharsis, Elysium Mons is covered with lava flows.<br><br>The lower parts of Elysium Mons are also cut by large sinuous channels (or "rilles").  Features like these can be found on the Moon, where they were carved by lava. On Mars, there has been some suggestion that water, rather than lava, was responsible for the erosion. <br><br>This HiRISE image is covers a location where three different sinuous rilles (running generally west to east) come together and are then cut by a pair of faults (running roughly north-south).  The ground has pulled apart and dropped down in between these two faults, forming a depression that geologists call a "graben."?? Where there was more focused ground collapse, small depressions (or "pit craters") formed. The thick coating of dust makes it hard to tell what fluid last ran through the sinuous rilles in this location. However, the layers of hard rock that can be occasionally seen poking through the dust indicate that what they eroded, was a stack of lava flows. 
PSP_003442_1215	This image shows light-toned layered deposits along the floor of Spallanzani crater, a 72 kilometer (45 mile) diameter crater located just southeast of Hellas Planitia.<br><br>These layered deposits may be remnant sediments once deposited within the crater. Mechanisms for sediment deposition include windblown debris, airfall volcanic ash, or sediments that accumulated in a lake on the crater floor. <br><br>The layers within Spallanzani Crater are eroding in a stair-stepped pattern. Each layer appears as a sequence of a broad flat area or plateau, which drops off abruptly down to the next flat surface (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003442_1215_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 1045 x 585, 597 KB). This stair-stepped pattern suggests that the layers have discreet boundaries that may be the result of differing compositions, time of deposition, or both. Near, but not at the edge of each plateau, the material is fracturing into polygonal plates or blocks that tilt downward away from the plateau center (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003442_1215_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). <br><br>The slopes are covered in debris, and not fallen plates or blocks from the plateau edge. This suggests that the layers are composed of weak materials that are protected by a stronger, more coherent surface.<br><br>The crater is named after the 18th century Italian biologist, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazzaro_Spallanzani'>Lazzaro Spallanzani</a> (1729-1799).

This may be an example of an expanding morphology, where new channels are formed as the older ones fill and are no longer efficiently channeling the subliming gas out.  
PSP_003450_1975	The aureole that surrounds the western and northern sectors of Olympus Mons has puzzled Mars geologists. The most common idea is that these deposits formed as giant land slides as the volcano partially collapsed under its own weight.<br><br>This HiRISE image is centered on a dark and relatively dust-free part of the aureole. Where the dust has been stripped off, swirling bands of darker and lighter rocks are visibile.  These suggest gently warped layers that have been exposed by erosion.  In fact, many of the small pinnacles and mesas in this area are being eroded by the wind in the same way as layered deposits in other parts of Mars. However, there are also blocks that shed dark material, that could be broken up lava rock. The many dunes in the area suggest that much of the debris is sand sized.  <br>

PSP_003464_1380	PSP_003464_1380 is a spectacular image showing gullies associated with distinct layers located at multiple elevations along one crater wall as well as multiple generations of dunes that are eroding or covering a more coherent rock structure. <br><br>The gullies in this crater appear to originate at the layers that cover a large extent of the slope. On the left side of the image, gullies can be seen emanating from layers in two distinct sets, each at a different elevation. Gullies are often, but not always, form near layers.   <br><br>Many of the gullies seen here have sinuous, or wavy, channels. The bends are called meanders, and on Earth, meanders form in streams that have sustained and/or repeated flow. Not all of the gullies seen in this image extend the same distance downslope. This could result from differences in water supply, sediment supply, slope angle, and time of formation, among other factors.<br><br>Dunes are also visible in this image; they indicate the prevailing wind direction.   What is particularly interesting about this dune field is that there is exposed rock in the middle of it. This rock is either being exposed as the wind moves the dunes away from it or it is being covered. The dunes appear to outline the shape of the rock, which suggests that the rock has been uncovered long enough for dunes to form around it.  <br><br>As the dunes shift over time, they will probably expose more of the underlying rock.  The <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003464_1380_cut_b.jpg'>subimage (~1 km across; 1976x1378, 8MB) shows</a> several generations of dunes interacting with the protruding rock.
PSP_003476_1940	This image captures a small piece of the southern edge of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the Solar System.<br><br>A pair of deep valleys can be see in the middle of the image, probably formed by ancient landslides. However, more recent lava flows have entered into the valley. These lava flows traverse the floor of the valley and feed a broad fan of lava flows at the mouth.  The dark streaks along the valley walls are locations where the bright dust has been removed by small dust avalanches. 
PSP_003492_1405	This image shows a southern mid-latitude crater: it has bright landslides on its southeast and west walls, some of which have noticeable boulder tracks where boulders rolled down the slopes.<br><br>The most noticeable features of this crater are the gullies on the north wall. A couple of small gullies appear to emanate from an overhang. The others originate at or near layers up-slope. The layers are sturdy and resistant from erosion: the layers that appear to be decaying into resolvable boulders, instead of particles easily moved by the wind, are evidence of this.<br><br>The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_003400_003499/PSP_003492_1405/PSP_003492_1405_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'>color portion of this observation</a> is spectacular. Note the distinct, blue layers lining the south rim of the crater and the white-blue rocks poking through. Wind erosion will likely expose them as time continues.<br><br>The top part of the image captures the complex floor of a larger crater upon which the featured crater is superposed. There are a large number of dunes as well as prominent ridges. The color contrast of the gullies to their surroundings is quite distinct. The gullies have blue channels; however, their down-slope debris aprons are redder. This probably indicates a change in particle size, or that the debris aprons have been covered with dust to blend into their surroundings.<br><br>Please note that this image is false color; it is not as it would appear naturally to the human eye.
PSP_003494_2075	This image shows cratered cones in Utopia Planitia. Cones with summit craters join together in places to form ridges up to several kilometers long, with troughs running along the summit. In many of these cases it is evident that the ridge systems formed by merging of multiple cones, since the arcs of individual cones can be distinguished. <br><br>These features are probably formed by eruption of subsurface material-mud or lava. Lava can form cinder or spatter cones, and eruptions from localized sources along a fissure could produce the ridges. The absence of obvious lava flows near the cones may argue against this mechanism, but ascending lava could have interacted with subsurface water or ice, leading to a more explosive eruption. An alternative is eruptions of pressurized mud from depth (mud volcanism), a process which occurs in certain environments on Earth. <br><br>This image has a few minor gaps where transmission errors caused data to be lost. These appear as narrow black bars.
PSP_003516_1540	This HiRISE image is centered on a large landslide which formed the large lobe at the base of the steep slope. This is material which was transported in a massive rock-slide. <br><br>The landslide has several ridge-and-trough lineations in the direction of the flow. These occur in similar landslides on Earth as well. Comparing these features on Mars with similar examples on Earth helps geologists better understand how they work on both planets. <br><br>In this case, the slide is relatively old. The material has many impact craters superimposed. The steep slope, which was the source of the landslide, has undergone further erosion, so the landslide source area is no longer clear. 
PSP_003520_1010	This image is located in the South Polar region of Mars and was suggested by Richard Smithís class at Titusville High School in Titusville, FL.<br><br>In this image, we can see ìspidersî likely caused by the sublimation of carbon dioxide ice. (Sublimation means the change of this ice from a solid directly to a gas.)  As this happens, the gas moves through channels until it reaches the surface <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_003520_1010_cut.jpg'><strong>and vents out.</strong></a>  These vents show up as the dark streaks because they carry dust and dirt up to the surface.<br>
PSP_003532_1845	Giant floods of lava have covered much of the equatorial lowlands of Mars in the recent geological past. One such flood of lava passed through the narrow gap near the center of this HiRISE image.<br><br>The pass is only 2.3 km (1.4 miles) wide, yet the flows went on for another 500 km (300 miles) to the west. As the lava passed through the narrows, the surface of the flow became crumpled and broken, producing a rough surface. To the southeast, the flow moved more gently and the crust was slowly pushed up by liquid lava injected into the freezing lava flow.<br><br>Small irregular cones along the margins of the flow were created by explosions as water or ice underneath the lava flow boiled. While lava flows approaching this size have formed on Earth, the rapid erosion on our planet has destroyed the upper surfaces of the lava flows.  Mars provides an extremely valuable opportunity to study aspects of giant lava flows that cannot be seen on Earth.
PSP_003538_1885	This image shows a dry cataract within Ares Vallis. A cataract is a large waterfall where there is a high, steep drop. The presence of this large cataract in Ares Vallis confirms that this channel was carved by water, probably in one or many large catastrophic flooding events.<br><br>This feature has many of the same characteristics as the cataracts on Earth associated with the flood that carved the Channelled Scablands in Washington state, including horseshoe-shaped headcuts and longitudinal grooves.  These grooves in the lower portion of the image lead up to the cataract, with the water flowing from the south to the north in this image. It then flowed down the cataract into the smaller incised channel.<br><br>The horseshoe-shaped headcut here is only part of a larger cataract system, and probably formed during the last stage of flooding. The inner channels are now filled with dunes formed by wind blowing along the channel floor. 
PSP_003540_1735	This image shows various interesting structures along the floor of Candor Chasma, a major canyon of Valles Marineris. <br><br>The rocks along the floor of the chasma consist of multiple layers of light-toned material, possibly windblown or water-lain sediment. These layers have been shifted along faults and also folded, giving the layers an apparent wavy appearance as they are exposed at the surface through erosion. <br><br>Some waviness in the layers may also have formed as these sediments were laid down, for example, in dunes or large ripples. Detailed mapping of these faults and folds may help reveal the origin of these layered deposits and if water played any role in their formation.
PSP_003542_2035	<a href='../2007/details/cut/PSP_003542_2035_cut_b.jpg'>This is a portion</a> of PSP_003542_2035 which shows a dark slope streak north of Olympus Mons, in a region was covered by Mars Orbital Camera image R09/00701. (This portion is rotated with south up so that the direction the streak flowed is towards the bottom of the frame; image is 1086x842, 3 MB).<br><br>This image shows that the slope streak forming process altered the pre-existing surface both by exacavating material and depositing it. The fine scalloped texture of the surrounding surface is not present within the streak, and there are low linear mounds within the streak that are not seen outside. Their absence outside the streak indicates that the formation of the mounds resulted from the streak formation process.<br><br>There is a large boulder or knob within the streak near the top of the frame which the dark slope streak appears to have flowed around, leaving a light-toned patch of the surrounding surface material intact downstream of the boulder.
PSP_003545_0995	This image was suggested by Vishal Bhalerao, a mechanical engineering student, from the K.K. Wagh Institute of Engineering Education in Maharashtra, India. <br><br>The image captures a small crater in the southern hemisphere near the south pole.  <br><br>Much of the ground surface is covered by polygonal fractures, common in high-latitude areas. This suggests there is (or was) ice just below the surface at this location. There are also <a href='http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/eolian/'>yardangs</a> (long landforms sculpted by the wind) and dunes within the crater suggesting aeolian activity. Aeolian (wind-driven) processes are currently very active on the surface of Mars.    <br><br>The dark and light patches at the top of the image are probably related to sublimation of carbon dioxide ice at this location.
PSP_003545_2025	Steve Hallaís class at <strong>Leap Academy Charter High School</strong> in Camden, NJ, suggested this image, a region near the intersection of Elysium Chasma and Hyblaeus Chasma. The class suggested that seeing a cross-section of Hyblaeus Chasma in the walls of Elysium Chasma might shed light on the mechanism(s) that formed it.  <br><br>A cross-section of Hyblaeu Chasma is visible in <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_003545_2025_cut_a.jpg'>the first subimage</a>. The chasm seems to be filled with a resistant light-toned layer, about 200 meters thick (likely consisting of cemented windblown sand and dust) forming a mantling unit and overlying more resistant boulder-rich layers. The sand and dust was likely blown into Hyblaeu Chasma after it was formed by <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/tectonic.php'>tectonic processes,</a> possibly in combination with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/fluvial.php'>fluvial processes.</a> The chasmata were subsequently broadened by hillslope erosion: boulders are strewn along the top of this dusty mantling unit. Slumping, possibly caused by faulting, along the southern wall of Hyblaeus is visible at the intersection with Elysium Chasma.<br><br>This image also shows a number of dark streaks along the walls of Elysium Chasma, further to the south. One fresh-appearing streak <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_003545_2025_cut_b.jpg'>divides around a slight ridge in the second subimage</a> (about 1 kilometer across). Other smaller, fainter, possibly older streaks have formed on either side of this ridge, producing a herringbone-like pattern. A number of explanations have been suggested for these streaks, including the idea that they are formed by dry avalanches of dust.<br>
PSP_003565_1495	This target was suggested by Jonna Sotelo Douglas in Tucson, Arizona.  She writes: "This image is of the confluence of the Nigral and Uzboi Valles and part of the southern rim of  Luki crater. The confluence area is marked with dunes, boulders, and other types of sediment formations. As the elevation lowers from the crater wall, the area smoothes out. There are gullies on both sides of the crater wall."<br> <br>Nirgal and Uzboi Valles are two valleys to the north of the Argyre impact basin in the southern hemisphere. At this location, the smaller channel, Nirgal Vallis, empties out into the larger Uzboi Vallis. <br> <br>Most of the features in this image are covered by the dust that is ubiquitous on Mars, hiding the original fluvial features. However, a small patch of resistant outcrop can be observed on the southern side of the crater rim. These appear as white patches that are draped by the darker wind-blown rippled sand (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003565_1495_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage 1</a>).  Even the resistant outcrop has been modified by wind, giving it a pockmarked or scalloped texture. <br> <br>Layering can be seen in the resistant outcrops and in the gullied inner wall of the crater (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003565_1495_cut_c.jpg'>see subimage 2</a>). These layers may have been fluvial, volcanic, or aeolian (wind-blown).  Given their presence within the valley floor, these may represent some of the sedimentary layers deposited by water when it flowed through the valley. 
PSP_003570_1915	This image of a large hill in Marte Vallis has numerous dark- and light-toned streaks along its slopes, showing a variety of characteristics observed in other areas with these features. <br><br>For example, several dark streaks have formed "fingers" at their termini (where the streaks end). Their formation may be due to the material "feeling" the roughness of the ground as it reaches shallower slopes near the base of the hill. The dark streaks also appear to travel over many obstacles along their paths, such as impact craters, small boulders, and rock outcrops. This indicates that the slope streaks have sufficient momentum and energy early in their descent downslope that they are not affected by such features or the ground. The slope streaks also do not start at a common elevation along the sides of the hill, suggesting that they are not related to any particular layer(s) of material.<br><br>Dark slope streaks are thought to fade over time by deposition of new bright dust on top of streaked surface. The presence of light-toned streaks relative to their surrounding darker-toned surface is particularly interesting. Scientists have wondered: if dark streaks fade over time by deposits of new dust, then how can there be light-toned streaks? Does this mean light-toned streaks are formed differently? Are the materials of a light-toned streak different from dark-toned streaks? <br><br>Slope streaks have been discovered and studied since the early Mariner and Viking missions to Mars in the 1960s and 1970s. Scientists are hoping to resolve some of these questions using HiRISE images with its high spatial resolution compared to these previous Mars datasets.
PSP_003573_2110	This image shows terrain in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The area is generally smooth and flat, but this image shows several hills.<br><br>The northern part of the image is dominated by a roughly circular hill with streaks of material radiating from it; a few smaller hills with pitted summits occur to the south. These features could have originated in volcanic eruptions or a process called ìmud volcanism.î <br><br>The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_003500_003599/PSP_003573_2110/PSP_003573_2110_COLOR.abrowse.jpg'>IRB false-color data</a> shows that distinct color differences occur within the image. The northernmost part of the image is a deep blue, while most of the plains are pale blue and the hills are distinctly yellow. Some part of the coloration of the image may be due to dust coating, but the similarity of the various hills suggests that they all have similar composition and so may have a related origin. <br><br>Minor striations in the color along the axis of the image are visible at the southern edge. These are artifacts that occasionally appear between HiRISE channels.
PSP_003583_1425	PSP_003583_1425 shows incredible details of a crater with gullies that provides strong evidence for gully formation involving fluid flow.<br><br>Of note is the variety of gully morphologies along the crater walls. The north and west walls have gullies, while the south wall has only landslides. "Mass wasting" is the more general term geologists use to describe landslides, slumps, and other movements of the ground in response to gravity. It usually occurs on steep slopes when the force of gravity causes weak or loose material to travel downslope. Mass wasting produces structures that are sometimes similar to gully channels, but which can usually be distinguished by their occurrence <br>on steep slopes.<br><br>The gullies on the north wall have eroded all the way to the crater rim. They appear older than other nearby gullies because they have existed long enough to be modified by permafrost processes as evidenced by the polgyonal fractures found on some of the channel and inter-gully walls. Another noticeable difference among the gullies is channel lengths. The gullies on the north wall and the group just to the left of these have much shorter channels than the gullies on the northwest wall. It is possible that the gullies with shorter channels had less fluid flow through their systems. The gullies appear to originate around a sequence of rocky layers near the crater rim.<br><br>Many of the gully channels appear to have boulders littered throughout (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003583_1425_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 640 m across; 2550 x 2000, 14MB). This is suggestive of a fluid flowing in these channels; a fluid would preferentially transport smaller particles and leave behind the larger ones, such as the boulders seen here. There are many overprinted small channels in each gully, as can be seen in the subimage.  These are indicative of multiple flow events such that some channels experience flow, then are abandoned. <br><br>The subimage also shows several channels merging. Particularly interesting is the channel flowing from the top of the scene. There are several intertwining channels that merge into one just to the right of the center of the subimage. However, the way some channels truncate others suggests that there were at least three episodes of flow through this area.
PSP_003595_2115	This image samples the rugged central portion of the mysterious "aureole" that extends to the west and north of Olympus Mons.<br><br>While many ideas for its formation have been advanced over the decades, these days it is generally thought to be a giant landslide deposit. The scene here fits that model with kilometer-scale (mile-sized) rocky hummocks and blocks strewn about.  The blocks themselves are now covered with dust that is slumping off in small landslides or avalanches.  These leave dark streaks on the sides of the blocks. 
PSP_003597_1765	HiRISE image PSP_003597_1765 shows fractured mounds on the southern edge of Elysium Planitia.<br><br>The mounds are typically a few kilometers in diameter and about 200 feet tall. The fractures that crisscross their surfaces are dilational (extensional) in nature, suggesting that the mounds formed by localized uplift (i.e., they were pushed up from below).<br><br>The mounds are probably composed of solidified lava. They are contiguous with, and texturally similar to, the flood lavas that blanket much of Elysium Planitia, and, where dilation cracks provide cross-sectional exposure, the uplifted material is rocky.<br><br>Patches of mechanically weak and disrupted material overlie the rocky mound material. This is particularly conspicuous in the northeast corner of the HiRISE image. These patches may be remnants of a layer that was once more continuous but has been extensively eroded. Smooth lava plains fill the low-lying areas between the mounds. They are riddled with sinuous pressure ridges. The entire area is covered by a relatively thin layer of dust and sand.
PSP_003605_2015	Landslides are one of the most spectacular <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'>mass wasting</a> features on Mars in terms of their areal extent and volume. Some of the best preserved landslides are in the Valles Marineris canyon system, but that's not the only place we see evidence for landslides.<br><br>This image of Bahram Vallis, a valley along the edges of the circum-Chyrse Basin, has large mounds of material at the base of the valley floor. These deposits of material are different from those deposits seen at Valles Marineris. They do not have a "ribbed" surface of transverse ridges. They also do not have a semi-circular distal margin giving it a lobate appearance and they have not travelled for many kilometers away from their source region like most Valles Marineris landslides do. <br><br>These particular deposits have the characteristic shape of rotational landslides or slumps on Earth where material along the entire wall slumps down and piles debris at the base of the slope, much like a person who slumps down the back of a chair. Right at the cliff edge at the top of the slope, the shape of the area where the valley wall gave way to a landslide is not straight, but rather curved or semi-circular. This is typical of large landslides where the failure area has an arcuate "crown" shape. The fact that landslides have occurred here indicates that the valley walls are not stable and the materials respond to Martian gravity with mass movements. <br><br>Scientists studying landslides can use these images along with topographic data to model how the wall failed, which can give clues to the nature of the materials (type, strength, etc.) in this region. Another consequence of landslide activity in Bahram Vallis is that the overall width of the valley will increase over time.
PSP_003608_1510	This image taken at a high sun angle shows the relatively unshadowed pristine and youthful rayed crater Zumba.<br><br>The crater‚Äôs rim-to-rim diameter is approximately 3 kilometers (1.85 miles) with a depth of about 620 meters (0.4 miles), and its rim rises about 200 meters (656 feet) above the surrounding lava-filled plains of Daedalia Planum, just southwest of the great Tharsis volcanoes. (For an appreciation of the dimensions of this crater, <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/ANAGLYPH/PSP/ORB_002100_002199/PSP_002118_1510_PSP_003608_1510/PSP_002118_1510_PSP_003608_1510_RED.browse.png'><strong>see the anaglyph for Zumba.</strong></a>) Zumba is approximately 25% deeper than the average Martian crater of this size ‚Äì just one of several attributes that suggests it is a very fresh crater.<br><br>One estimate of Zumba‚Äôs age, generally accomplished by counting smaller superimposed craters on Zumba itself, suggests it may be 5 million years young. Even if such an estimate is off by 2-4 times, this is still a young geologic feature by Mars standards. Because Zumba is so young and so fresh, it is a perfect example of a simple crater.  On Mars, a simple crater is generally less than 6-9 km (about 3.7-5.6 mi) in diameter with a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù conical-bowl shape, minimal wall collapse, and lacking a well-developed central feature (e.g., a peak, large pit, or ring). <br><br>By impacting into such hard durable rocks, the impact that created Zumba scattered greater than 10 million ejecta blocks at high speeds resulting in far-reaching ray segments and an impressive field of secondary impact craters (<a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_003608_1510_cut.jpg'><strong>see the subimage</strong></a>). This pattern is hard to see in visible-light images, but ‚Äúlights-up‚Äù spectacularly in nighttime thermal infrared images taken by THEMIS onboard the Mars Odyssey 2001 Orbiter (<a href= http://themis.asu.edu/features/gratteri><strong>see Gratteri Crater's Far-Flung Rays</strong></a>). Scientists believe that some of these high-speed rocks may have even been expelled from Mars and even traveled to Earth (see <a href=http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Jan07/MarsRayedCraters.html><strong>Did Martian Meteorites Come From These Sources?</strong></a>).<br><br>Zumba is of considerable interest to scientists, whether it‚Äôs a source of Martian meteorites or not, as it possesses interesting features that are typically buried or eroded away in other older Martian craters, and even within the freshest terrestrial craters (including Meteor crater in Arizona; see Meteor crater in Google Earth: <a href='images/2009/details/cut/Meteor_crater.kmz'><strong>Meteor crater.kmz</strong></a>). These preserved and newly recognized features observed at the scale of HiRISE may reveal aspects of the impact process unknown to scientists from previous studies of craters on the terrestrial planets. <br><br>What is particularly intriguing is the presence of a pitted deposit giving Zumba the appearance that it has a relatively flat floor despite the pits. These crater-fill deposits are typically composed of lightly to highly damaged rock fragments and impact melts formed from the high temperatures achieved from the energy released by the impact event (i.e., on the order several to tens of megatons). The pits in the crater-fill deposits have not been recognized within lunar or terrestrial craters and appear to be unique to crater-fill deposits in only the freshest and best-preserved Martian craters.<br><br>These pits may represent the result of the interactions of the very hot crater-fill deposits with water and water-ice that may have been present in the subsurface prior to impact. It is not well understood whether these pits form explosively (similar to terrestrial volcanic pits/craters formed from the interaction of hot lava with wet sediments/deposits), or by collapse from the drainage of impact melts or volatiles. The presence of pitted deposits in only the freshest and well-preserved craters suggests that they are likely related to the impact process.<br>
PSP_003609_1110	This image was suggested by Andras Sik's SUPERNOVA astronomy and space research class at the Alternative Secondary School of Economics in Budapest, Hungary.<br><br>They interpret the image: "During local springtime, a varying albedo pattern can be observed on the surface of dark intracrater dune fields in the southern polar region of Mars. The origin of dark dune spots and the dark slope streaks emanating from them is yet uncertain. There are several possible explanations for these phenomena, like "sublimation of carbon-dioxide frost cover", "dusty carbon-dioxide gas eruptions through the frost cover" and "transient liquid water-formation under layered water-ice/carbon dioxide-ice cover". In this HiRISE image the distribution of dark streaks are not chaotic and their shapes are not fan-like; rather they are composed of confined, dozen-hundred meter long branches which follow the local topography and have accumulation zones at their end."<br><br>We are learning a great deal from the enigmatic dark spots that are found throughout the south polar region. These dark spots may have resulted from cold gas jets that form by sublimation of the ice bringing entrained dust to the surface. Small dark streaks may have formed by avalanches of sand or they may be patches of coarse-grained ice that are clear enough so that the dark material below the ice is visible.<br><br>The color image also provides helpful clues to understand this process. Bright white frost can be seen covering the surface. This frost is a probably a combination of frozen water and carbon dioxide ice. These bright patches are particularly prevalent along dune slip faces and around dark spots.
PSP_003617_1835	Max Fomitchev at Pennsylvania State University suggested this target.  He writes, "(This image) captures an enigmatic approximately 6 kilometer-wide area in central Aram Chaos, a crater that is about 1000 kilometers in diameter located east of Valles Marineris and just north of the equator.<br><br>"The image depicts the edge of a light-toned cap unit forming two large sheets in the middle of this chaotic terrain. This cap unit (which occupies the northern half of the image; <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003617_1835_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage 1</a>; 2024 x 1611; 9MB) is heavily eroded forming the 'icing' texture and terminates with a sharp approximately 300 meter cliff going diagonally across the image. Bright outcrops (yellow <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003617_1835_cut_c.jpg'>in the color subimage 2</a>; 2024 x 3291; 19MB) on the cliff  wall [may be the material identified by OMEGA as sulfates] while the exceptionally smooth dark-colored material at the bottom of the cliff is (probably dust or debris). This material is likely to have been deposited via erosion of the cap unit and (may have been) related to fluvial processes.<br><br>"In the past, the entire Aram Chaos Crater (may have) once been an ice-covered lake connected to a nearby valley via an outflow channel and underwent several episodes of catastrophic flooding. Thus, the multiple cracked overlapping layers of the chaotic terrain (may have) formed in presence of transient water and ice. Nowadays, Aram Chaos (may contain) water-rich minerals (including hematite deposits identified by TES) and thus (may) provide an ideal site for exploration of water-related processes on present day Mars."<br>
PSP_003618_1725	The amount of time that a geologic deposit is exposed at the surface can be measured by counting the number of impact craters that is contains in a given area. The longer a deposit is exposed at the surface the more impact events that it endures. <br><br>In this image, there are at least two distinct geologic units, a lightñtoned bedrock and a surface veneer of darkñtoned material that contains sand dunes. The lightñtoned bedrock must be older that the darkñtoned veneer of sand; the bedrock must have been present first in order to be covered by the sand. The darkñtoned sand however, contains many more impact craters than the lightñtoned bedrock. This suggests that the surface of the bedrock is younger than the veneer of sand. <br><br>This can be explained by the bedrock being more easily eroded by the wind than the veneer of sand. The surface of the bedrock is rapidly refreshed (craters smoothed away), while the sand veneer retains impact craters for a longer period of time. This indicates that the bedrock is very friable (weak and easily eroded, in this case by the wind) and the sand veneer is less friable.
PSP_003637_2020	Larissa Beckstead's third grade class from Sunridge Elementary School, in Phoenix, Ariz., suggested this target. When tasked with writing a figure caption, the class wrote: "Iberus Vallis looks like it has been carved by water. The shape is curved and looks like a river. The bends in the channel show how the water changed direction like rivers on Earth. The sides of the channel are high so it looks like Iberus Vallis has been there a long time. The less deep channels that branch off the main channel may have been caused by overflow of water. The shape of Iberus Vallis is evident that water was there at one time. Iberus Vallis is in the northeastern hemisphere of Mars. The channel is located on the southeast side of what looks like a volcano. It appears to be going down the side of the volcano."<br><br>In fact, Iberus Vallis is a valley to the southeast of Elysium Mons, a large volcano in the northern hemisphere.  This image is located at 21.5 degrees north and 151.5 degrees East.  Within the valley, many large boulders are resolved in the HiRISE image (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003637_2020_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 713 x 591, 1.2MB ). A thick resistant layer is exposed at the top of the wall, as are some thinner resistant layers below.<br><br>Three unusual mounds (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003637_2020_cut_c.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 704 x 584, 1.2MB) are present in the channel. Their origins are unknown, though they could potentially be ice-cored mounds. <br><br>Dust fills much of the floor of the valley, and has been moved by the wind to form dunes. Although water at one point carved this valley, it is now dominated by mass wasting (dry landslides) and aeolian (wind-driven) processes.
PSP_003639_1345	This image was suggested by Andras Sik's SUPERNOVA astronomy and space research class at the Alternative Secondary School of Economics in Budapest, Hungary.  <br><br>They write: "In the fretted terrains and in the eastern region of the Hellas Basin rim, many plateaus can be found surrounded by a skirt-like debris cover. These debris aprons can extend to 15-25 kilometers long; they have a convex shape, steep front slopes and differ from gravitational talus or fluvial fans. (There may be) ice cores and/or ice cement in the apron material, therefore the closest terrestrial analogs are periglacial rock (terrains). This HiRISE image shows a small part of Euripus Mons' debris apron [at a] very high resolution so its detailed surface morphology can be investigated and compared to field observations of terrestrial rock glaciers."<br><br>Euripus Mons is located to the east of Hellas impact basin in the Southern mid-latitudes of Mars.<br><br>The overall wavy, curved surface pattern of this debris apron suggests that material flowed out from the isolated flat-top ridge. This mass movement of debris probably involved ice flow (possibly forming rock glaciers) and potentially liquid water. <br><br>A closer view of the upper portion of the image (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003639_1345_cut_c.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 718 x 588; 1MB), reveals that rough sharp scalloped ridges are particularly prominent. This scalloping may have resulted from sublimation of ice below the surface.<br><br>At full resolution, polygonal features can be observed (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003639_1345_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 722 x 596; 1.2MB), which are characteristic of periglacial terrains. These polygons form by the contraction and expansion of the ground due to freezing and thawing of ice just below the surface during seasonal changes. <br><br>All of these features provides evidence that ice was or is present just below the surface at this location. This apron is not pockmarked with craters, suggesting it is relatively young in age.<br>
PSP_003647_1745	This image shows a very dark spot on an otherwise bright dusty lava plain to the northeast of Arsia Mons, one of the four giant Tharsis volcanoes.<br><br>This is not an impact crater as it lacks a raised rim or ejecta.   What's amazing is that we cannot see any detail in the shadow!  The <a href='http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2007/details/cut/PSP_3647_1745_cut_b.jpg'>cutout shows this dark spot</a> and a version that is "stretched" to best see the darkest area, yet we still cannot see details except noise (1380x782, 1 MB).<br><br>The HiRISE camera is very sensitive and we can see details in almost any shadow on Mars, but not here. We also cannot see the deep walls of the pit.  The best interpretation is that this is a collapse pit into a cavern or at least a pit with overhanging walls. We cannot see the walls because they are either perfectly vertical and extremely dark or, more likely, overhanging.<br><br>The pit must be very deep to prevent detection of the floor from skylight, which is quite bright on Mars.
PSP_003655_1885	This image shows a portion of a mound partly filling an impact crater. The impact crater is a little more than 60 kilometers (37 miles) across, and the central mound about half that, extending well beyond the area shown here. <br><br>Large impact craters typically have central peaks which surge upwards in the last stage of crater formation. However, mounds like this represent a different process: sedimentary infill of the crater after its formation.  <br><br>At this site, the mound appears to be layered. Step-forming layers crop out throughout the center of the image. This indicates that the mound material was deposited in a series of events, likely the same process repeating many times. Many processes could form layers like this, including aeolian (wind) deposition, volcanic ash, or lake sedimentation. Unfortunately, fine details of the layers are obscured by dust which covers most of the mound. Avalanches in this dust layer are responsible for the many small dark streaks in the image. <br><br>However the material in the mound formed, it was once even more extensive, perhaps entirely filling the crater. Wind erosion has caused the elongated, fluted shapes called yardangs. 
PSP_003656_2015	Becquerel Crater is one of several impact craters in Arabia Terra that have light-toned layered deposits along the crater floor. The light-toned deposits are particularly striking to look at in this HiRISE image because they are stacked together to produce a thick sequence of layered beds. The layers appear to be only a few meters thick and show little variations in thickness. <br><br>On Earth, layered beds with these characteristics are typically formed in water environments, although aeolian (wind blown) deposition on Mars through a cyclic process is also possible. Volcanic eruptions would not be expected to produce ash or volcanic flows of such regular thickness, and there are no nearby volcanic vents. <br><br>Some of the layering in the image appears dark, probably due to deposition of basalt sand along flatter surfaces rather than any compositional variations in the layer beds themselves. Faults can also be seen displacing portions of the layered beds. The surface of the light-toned deposit is not smooth but instead appears disrupted into polygonal cracks and blocks. <br><br>Relative to most surfaces on Mars, there are almost no impact craters seen in this image. This is not due to a young age but rather to the friable (easily eroded) nature of the light-toned layered deposits that enable wind easily to erode the unit, thereby removing any impact craters. Evidence of erosion by the wind is most apparent in the bottom of the image where linear ridges most likely formed by wind scouring away material in a north-south direction and creating the ridges.
PSP_003663_1775	HiRISE image PSP_003663_1775 covers a portion of the Martian equatorial plains called Elysium Planitia. In this location, lava that was once flowing across the surface interacted with multiple obstructions. <br><br>The image is near the southern margin of where these flows occurred, and it is likely that the obstructions are small hills in the underlying surface that poked up through the flow. As the flowing material moved past the obstructions, piles of rocky debris banked up on the northwestern or upstream sides while long trails or "wakes" were left on the southeastern or downstream side. Changes in the direction of the "wakes" indicate that the direction of flow altered somewhat over time, and fractures across the surface show the top of the flow was carried along as a brittle "skin." <br><br>The rough and blocky nature of the material where it piles along obstructions and other attributes suggest the flowing material was lava and was part of a much larger and relatively young (by geologic standards) flow that occurred in this part of Mars.<br>
PSP_003686_1865	Ascraeus Mons is the northernmost of the three giant Tharsis Montes volcanoes, with large channels carved into the lower parts of its flanks.<br><br>There has been a long-standing debate whether these were eroded by flowing water or lava.  The section seen in this HiRISE images favors the lava hypothesis, since the shapes of the "islands" in the channel are not as streamlined as would be expected from water erosion.  Instead, they have the same shape as was seen in lava channels on the Earth, such as the early phases of the ongoing eruption of Kilauea volcano or the 1984 eruption of Mauna Loa volcano (both in Hawaii). <br><br>The very sharp bend in the channel is also uncommon for water carved channels and suggests that the erosion was taking advantage of weaknesses in the volcano caused by faults and fractures. Unfortunately, we cannot tell for sure what the fluid was because of the thick coating of dust. HiRISE reveals the intricate sculpting of this dust as the wind predominantly blows from northwest to southeast. However, in the channel, the wind generally runs down the channel, sometimes even going perpendicular to the wind outside it.
PSP_003695_1250	PSP_003695_1250 shows a southern hemisphere crater with gullies, dunes, periglacial modification, bright rock deposits, and dust devil tracks. Although these features are all common on Mars, there are not many places that have all of them together as viewed here.<br><br>The gullies seen at the top of the image are likely caused by wet debris flows. They have deposits of multiple ages. The gully on the left has bright deposits that have been modified by periglacial processes overlain by slightly darker deposits that have not been modified.  Periglacial processes, such as seasonal freezing and thawing, are responsible for the polygonal fractures seen near the gullies and around the image.<br><br>The dark material in the center of the image is a dune field.  There are several different sizes and orientations of dunes&mdash;these different orientations indicate that the dominant winds in the area have changed throughout time.<br><br>The dark streaks that criss-cross on the outskirts of the dune field are dust devil tracks. Dust devils are spinning cells of dust that travel across the Martian surface. As they move, they pick up and redeposit particles, as well as disturbing dust on the surface. They are responsible elsewhere on Mars for removing dust from the solar panels of the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, which has helped to extend their missions way beyond the 90-day primary mission.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003695_1250_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage,</a> 750 meters across, shows dust devil tracks near the southwest edge of the dune field.  The bright protruding rocks to the right of the image are either being exposed or being buried as the dunes migrate. (Subimage dimensions: 3000 x 2000; 5 MB).<br><br>Note that the black rectangular feature near the top right of the image is a data gap resulting from data transmission problems; it is not a real feature.
PSP_003708_1335	This image shows part of a relatively small (14 kilometers, or 9 miles across) unnamed impact crater in Noachis Terra. The lobate-shaped crater's ejecta, gullies in its walls, and "concentric crater fill" in the crater's floor may be indicative of the presence of water and ice at some point during its history.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003708_1335_cut_b.jpg'> subimage </a> of a <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru_ctx.html'> CTX </a> context image of this same crater shows the typical lobate ejecta pattern characteristic of rampart craters, indicating that ice- or water-rich materials were excavated at the time of impact. According to this theory, the rock ejected from the crater mixed with the water and water vapor, and thus flowed more easily along the surface. Another possible interpretation is that fine-grained rocky material mixed with air and formed the rampart pattern in the absence of water.<br><br>The gullies shown in this image are similar to terrestrial gullies produced by flowing water. The current Martian climate would not allow for liquid water to be stable at the surface for extended periods of time, though. It is so cold (in the order of -70<sup>o</sup>C or -90<sup>o</sup>F) that the water would freeze, and then it would sublimate quickly, because the air is very dry and thin (the atmospheric pressure is on average less than 1/100 of that on Earth). These gullies could have formed under a different climate, or perhaps they were carved by short-lived streams; they could also have been produced by dry landslides.<br><br>"Concentric crater fill," crater-interior deposits that form concentric ridges, is found at high latitudes (approximately above 30 degrees from the equator). Theoretical calculations indicate that ice may exist under the surface at such high latitudes, mixed with rocks and soil. The roughly concentric ridges and troughs in this crater's floor may have been produced by compression caused by viscous flow of a thick mixture of rocks, soils, and ice inward from the crater's walls.
PSP_003710_1530	The formation of the approximately 150 km diameter Holden Crater interrupted the northward flowing Uzboi Vallis channel system. Relief associated with the rim of Holden effectively blocked the channel.<br><br>This image covers the portion of Holden Crater's rim where it was overtopped by water that had backed up in Uzboi Vallis to the south. Water flowing over the rim in multiple locations eventually focused on a single channel that then cut deeply into the rim.<br><br>After the impounded water drained into the crater, the steep wall on the east side of the main channel collapsed in a landslide that remains visible along the floor. Several outcroppings of variably bright material are visible in the scar produced by the slide.
PSP_003711_1275	Image PSP_003711_1275 shows part of a semi-circular embayment in the side wall of a valley. The valley is located in the southern hemisphere of Mars near the rim of the Argyre impact basin in the western Charitum Montes. The bottom of the image is near the top of the valley side wall and the top of the image shows the edge of the valley floor.<br><br>Several streamlined landforms can be seen on the wall of the valley. They have irregular shapes but are generally streamlined and are oriented in the direction of maximum slope. The streamlined hills vary in dimensions with widths up to hundreds of meters and lengths of more than a kilometer. <br><br>Near the top of the valley wall (near the bottom of the image) are several long and linear grooves. The grooves are locally parallel and are also oriented in the approximate downhill direction. <br><br>These morphologies may have formed from <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'>mass wasting processes</a>, <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/fluvial.php'>fluvial erosion</a>, or possibly erosion from strong winds. However, landforms in the surrounding area strongly suggest that this region was sculpted by glacial processes. The grooves therefore may have formed by glacial erosion in which rocks at the bottom of the ice abrade and scour the underlying bedrock.The orientation and morphology of the streamlined hills is also consistent with that of glacially sculpted bedrock or subglacial till deposits. <br><br>Future high resolution stereo imaging should reveal more diagnostic details, such as shape, symmetry, and relief, in the streamlined features.

PSP_003730_0945	This caption is part of a December 2007 AGU presentation <a href='/sim/'>"Spring at the South Pole of Mars."</a><br><br>The south polar region of Mars is covered seasonally with translucent carbon dioxide ice. In the spring gas subliming (evaporating) from the underside of the seasonal layer of ice bursts through weak spots, carrying dust from below with it, to form numerous dust fans aligned in the direction of the prevailing wind.<br><br>The dust gets trapped in the shallow grooves on the surface, helping to define the small-scale structure of the surface. The surface texture is <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003730_0945_cut_b.jpg'>reminiscent of lizard skin.</a>
PSP_003734_0950	Mars has a seasonal southern polar cap composed of carbon dioxide (CO2, commonly known as dry ice), that overlies a permanent polar cap which is a mixture of CO2 ice, water ice and dust.  As the CO2 evaporates in the spring the escaping gas carves channels in the permanent cap below.  Often these channels  radiate outward (or converge inward), giving them a spider-like appearance.  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003734_0950_cut_b.jpg'>In this false color image</a> the seasonal frost is whitish-lavendar (1507x1179; 5 MB). The tan areas starting to show through are where the frost has already evaporated (sublimated is actually the correct term, when ice changes directly to a gas). Tan-colored dust blows around and accummulates in the bottom of some of the channels.  <br><br>This is truly other-worldly terrain, with exotic landforms with no earthly analogs.  
PSP_003824_1470	Dao Vallis is a giant canyon carved into the side of the ancient volcano Hadriaca Patera. Imaging locations such as this can allow HiRISE to see the insides of Martian volcanoes.<br><br>In this case, the valley wall is covered with a mantling deposit that has been cut in many places by gullies. Only faint traces of rocky layers are visible. These might be extensively eroded ancient lava flows. <br><br>One striking aspect of this image is the dearth of impact craters, and the underlying surface is very ancient. However, the mantling deposit is young (or renews itself quickly).  <br><br>Features in this (and other HiRISE images of similar mantling deposits) complicate one of the many models for how gullies form. Based on lower resolution images, it was suggested that the head (or amphitheater) of the gullies was filled with dirty snow when Mars' climate was different. As the base of this snow pack melted, small rivulets of water would erode the gullies. The smooth mantling deposits found in the gullies were speculated to be patches of this snow that has survived to the present day.  <br><br>However, HiRISE sees large boulders in these deposits which would be difficult to have in a snow pack.
PSP_003830_1740	This image shows an area of layered deposits in Candor Chasma. Here, sheets and dunes of dark-toned sand cover the light-toned, layered bedrock. Accumulations of dark sand accentuate bedding within the light-toned bedrock, giving some areas a zebra striped pattern. <br><br>In the northern part of the scene, the bedrock has been eroded into steep, craggy cliffs. Some sections of these cliffs are covered by triangular-shaped debris fans that are intermediate in color between the dark-toned sand and light-toned bedrock.These fans may contain a mix of light-toned bedrock that has crumbled away from the surrounding cliffs and wind-blown sand and dust.<br><br>The surfaces of some fans are dissected by gullies, which most likely formed through dry avalanching. The bottoms of the gully channels are often darker in tone than the surrounding fan surface. This may be due to accumulations of wind-blown sand in the gully floor. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_003830_1740_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows a clear example</a> of a gullied fan from the northern portion of the scene.

PSP_003931_1370	This HiRISE image shows enigmatic banded terrain in Hellas Planitia. Hellas is an extremely large, ancient basin formed when an asteroid struck Mars billions of years ago. Good examples of the bands are visible at the northern edge of the image and in the lower left. <br><br>The reason for the banded texture is not certain, even with HiRISE resolution. Some of the band material appears to be extremely rich in small boulders about 1 meter across. It appears that the bands form topographic steps in places, likely due to erosion. Alternating strong and weak layers can produce steps like this as they are eroded. <br><br>It is not clear how the band material was deposited, but the convoluted appearance may be a product of deformation, coupled with erosion. Distortion in three dimensions, joined with partial erosion of the deposits, can produce complex textures. Further complications may arise because the banded material may be draped over underlying topography.
PSP_003948_0935	Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles. Because Mars is so much colder however, carbon dioxide ice is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring, analogous to winter-time water ice/snow on Earth. <br><br>Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter; this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' north polar cap.<br><br>As can be seen in this HiRISE image of the south pole residual cap, relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions. This patterned terrain is called "swiss cheese" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses of several to approximately 10 meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of this carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). As most depressions seem to have relatively flat floors, there is likely some layer below, possibly made of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Complicated shapes arise when neighboring growing depressions intersect.<br><br>A previous Mars imaging system, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took images of the same places on the south pole residual cap every year for many years, and showed that there are annual changes taking place within it. By looking at different sizes and shapes of depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of "swiss cheese" terrain can be described. The sublimation process may begin as a small, shallow depression in a smooth surface. This depression then deepens until reaching the resistant layer below, and continues to expand laterally in all directions, creating the generally round depressions we see today. Different heights and thicknesses of smooth areas, and different depths of depressions, may indicate that multiple episodes of accumulation and sublimation have occurred.<br><br>This is one of the locations previously monitored at lower resolution by MOC. With the high resolution and repeat-imaging capability of HiRISE, we intend to continue monitoring and better measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. This is one of the locations specifically targeted by HiRISE for this purpose.<br><br>Knowing the amount and rate of carbon dioxide removal can give us a better idea of the role of carbon dioxide (the main component of the Martian atmosphere) in polar and atmospheric processes, of current environmental and climatic conditions, and of how Mars climate may be changing.<br><br>In HiRISE images such as this one, it is evident on the slopes of the large, especially high mesa just above the center of the image that the carbon dioxide-rich material may be constructed of several individual horizontal layers. However, it also appears that as erosion eats into the mesa, pieces of a stronger mesa surface layer break off and are left strewn on the mesa slopes, where they may give the appearance of layering.<br><br>An interesting feature in this HiRISE image is the crisscrossing network of faint ridges and troughs on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice.

PSP_004000_0945	Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles. Because Mars is so much colder, however, the seasonal ice that is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring (generally analogous to winter time snow on Earth) is carbon dioxide ice. Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter&emdash;this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap.<br><br>Relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions, forming a pattern called "swiss cheese" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses probably of several meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). By looking at different sized depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of "swiss cheese" terrain can be observed.<br><br>The sublimation process may begin anywhere as a small depression. Once this small depression is formed, it expands laterally in all directions, creating the rounded depressions we see today. As most depressions seem to have a similar depth and have relatively flat bottoms, there is likely some layer below, possibly of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Thus, while the south polar residual cap as a whole is present every year, there are certainly annual changes taking place within it. <br><br>Especially apparent and interesting in this image are the strips of material that parallel the edges of many depressions. Often there are two or more concentric strips that are smooth like the surrounding surface, but seem to be lower than the surrounding surface and in places appear to be tilted down towards the center of the depression. Inner strips are sometimes broken up into chunks. It may be that the uppermost smooth layer is a bit more resistant to sublimation than the material just below it&emdash;the quicker removal of the underlying material might cause the stronger upper layer to detach from the surrounding terrain and settle down towards the center of the depression. <br><br>Alternatively, these ringing strips may indicate that many layers are present within the carbon dioxide ice. Another interesting feature is the faint crisscrossing network of ridges on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice.<br><br>With the high resolution capability of HiRISE, we intend to measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. Knowing the amount of carbon dioxide removed can give us an idea of the current atmospheric and climate conditions, and possibly how Mars climate may be changing. 
PSP_004000_1560	This image covers a portion of Eberswalde Crater, revealing a possible delta-lake transition. Water flowed into the crater through a series of tributary channels to the west of the crater and after the water entered, it formed a distributive network and partly filled the crater to form a lake (Eberswalde Crater is approximately 70 kilometers wide and 1.2 kilometers deep).  <br><br>The bright layers are part of the terminal scarp at the eastern edge of the delta. Some of the steeper slopes visible at the edge of the fan may be coarser-grained resistant channel ridges. The CRISM instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected phyllosilicates (clays) in the bright layers. One of the ways clays form on Earth is when water erodes rock and makes fine particles which settle out of water; this often occurs in river deltas and lake beds. The delta in Eberswalde Crater and the detection of phyllosilicates provides evidence for possible persistent aqueous activity on Mars.
PSP_004006_1900	This image shows part of a fracture that is approximately 800 meters (half a mile) wide. This fracture is part of a larger set of similar features that are collectively called Cerberus Fossae.<br><br>Some scientists suggest that lava, water, or both erupted from these fractures at some point in Mars' past. The presence of streamlined hills, such as those that are found in river channels on Earth, as well as lava flows, are some of the observations that lead scientists to this interpretation. Thus this fracture may be a large scale example of eruptive vents that form on volcanoes on Earth.
PSP_004018_1505	This HiRISE image shows bright layers on the floor of Columbus Crater, a large impact basin in the southern highlands of Mars. <br><br>The crater is very old and has gone through much modification. Its rim is relatively low and the floor is flat, and it is likely that material has been eroded from the rim and deposited on the crater floor. <br><br>The bright stripes that appear in this image at low resolution are likely sedimentary deposits. This bright material includes dark patches which may be embedded within it, or the dark material could be covering the light. The small-scale topography is rugged, likely an erosional characteristic of the dark material which covers much of the surface. <br><br>Bright materials like those visible here are found in many places on Mars. In this case, it is likely that they are part of the sediments that have filled the basin, but it is not certain how they were deposited. In many places, bright sediments exhibit fine horizontal banding, suggesting that they were once part of more extensive, flat-lying layers of rock. In the bright materials here, layering is rare and the original geometry somewhat more obscure. Impact craters in the scene have excavated the dark surface, but in several cases this has not exposed much layering or bright material.
PSP_004026_1765	The formation of the large outflow channels on Mars have been attributed to catastrophic discharges of ground water. Many of the channels start in areas where the ground has apparently collapsed: the surface is now well below the surrounding undisturbed ground. Within the collapsed region, blocks of undisturbed material can often be seen and this has led to such regions being called chaotic terrain.<br><br>In Aureum Chaos, the OMEGA experiment on Mars Express indicated the presence of phyllosilicates (clay minerals) which have been detected in a variety of bright outcrops and scarps. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004026_1765_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage shows</a> such an outcrop in a chaotic terrain region (600 x 600, 351 KB). At the highest resolution, layering can be seen. The image will be used to assess at what stage in Mars's history these clays minerals were formed and how.<br><br>The area referred to as Aureum Chaos is located at 334E, 4S on the west side of the Margaritifer Terra region of Mars.
PSP_004030_1855	In the center of this image is a very sharp-rimmed impact crater just 35 meters wide.  It lies in a bright, dust-covered region, but is surrounded by a slightly darker spot about three kilometers wide. The impact event created a blast of high winds that disturbed the dust and darkened the spot.<br><br>Since dust is constantly settling over the region, the fact that we can still see the dark region means the impact event occurred of late, perhaps in recent decades. There are many dark streaks on topographic slopes over an even wider region surrounding the dark spot--these could be due to dust avalanches triggered by the impact, either from the air blast or from seismic shaking of the ground.<br><br>There are also rays of very small (approximately one meter in diameter) secondary craters extending radially outward from the 35 meter crater, created by the impact of rocks ejected from the main crater. Thus a small impact crater has modified the surface over an area more then 10,000 times greater than that of the crater's interior.
PSP_004038_1255	The Russell Crater dune field is covered seasonally by carbon dioxide frost, and this image shows the dune field after the frost has sublimated (evaporated directly from solid to gas). There are just a few patches left of the bright seasonal frost.<br><br>Numerous dark dust devil tracks can be seen meandering across the dunes. The face of the largest dune is lined with gullies. The source of the gullies is unclear but could involve erosion by the seasonal carbon dioxide ice.
PSP_004044_1165	Image PSP_004044_1165 shows gullies in an unnamed crater approximately 25 kilometers (16 miles) in diameter and 1.2 kilometers (0.75 miles) deep, located south of Terra Sirenum. Several features associated with this crater suggest that, at some point in time, liquid and ice may have been present at and near the surface.<br><br>A <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/m13_m18/images/M13/M1301057.html'>MOC context image</a> of this crater shows the typical lobate ejecta pattern characteristic of rampart craters, interpreted by some as indicating ice-rich or water-rich materials was excavated at the time of impact. According to this theory, the rock debris ejected from the crater and mixed with the water flowed more easily along the surface. Other possible interpretation is that fine-grained rocky material mixed with air and formed the rampart pattern in the absence of water.<br><br>The HiRISE image shows gullies not only in the inside of the crater, but also in the outside, emerging from the elevated rim of the crater (NW corner of the image). The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004044_1165_cut_b.jpg'>subimage  (approximately 500 x 600 meters, or 480 x 550 yards; 1060 x 1155 pixels, 1.2MB) shows</a> one of the outside gullies; illumination is from the left, downhill is up. The box-like shape of its alcove suggest this gully may have been produced by groundwater sapping, as opposed to surface runoff. <br><br>Polygon patterns are ubiquitous in this image: on the walls of the crater, on its floor, and on the walls of some of the gullies. These polygons are similar to features observed in terrestrial permafrost such as in the Arctic and Antarctic. Polygonal patterns are produced by repeated expansion and contraction of frozen soil, due to seasonal temperature cycles.
PSP_004046_2080	This HiRISE image covers a small portion of the Elysium Fossae fracture system extending to the northeast from the giant Elysium Mons volcano.  <br><br>The relative roles of tectonics (motion along faults), volcanism, and water remain puzzling.  The large crater just north of the center of the HiRISE image appears to have formed by collapse, not by a meteorite impact. Had it been an impact crater, we would see a blanket of material (ejecta) that had been thrown out of the crater. <br><br>In general, this image demonstrates that this area has a similar stack of materials as other parts of the giant volcanoes on Mars.  The deepest exposed material appears to be a stack of lava flows that produce thick layers that shed boulders. Above is a layer of weak material, possibly wind blown dust.  Interestingly, in some areas (especially in the northern part of this image) there are thin, harder layers, more resistant to erosion, within the generally weak and easily eroded surface layer.  These resistant layers seem to be too thin to be lava flows, and may indicate that some other process has hardened or cemented (indurated) portions of the weak material.  
PSP_004052_2045	This image covers an impact crater roughly 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) in diameter.  The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004052_2045_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows just a small segment of the crater rim</a> (1336 x 889; 3 MB). The surface outside the crater (top) is relatively dark, while the interior wall of the crater has a lighter tone. A few dark patches on the crater wall have small dunes or ripples on their surfaces, and are likely pits filled with dark sand.<br><br>The light-toned material making up the crater wall is finely layered and fractured in places.  The layers may be part of a sedimentary or volcanic ash deposit that became indurated (cemented and solidified) prior to the impact that formed the crater.  The impact has revealed layers that were previously buried beneath the Martian surface, similar to the craters explored by the Opportunity rover in Meridiani Planum.  These craters are windows into the Martian subsurface.<br><br>Just 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the east of this crater lies Mawrth Vallis, an ancient outflow channel that may have been carved by catastrophic floods.  The orbiting spectrometers OMEGA (on Mars Express) and CRISM (on MRO) have detected clay minerals in layered deposits in and around Mawrth Vallis.  These minerals, which require water to form, are likely present in the layered bedrock exposed in this crater wall.  The crater may thus provide a glimpse into an intriguing period of Martian history, when liquid water may have been more abundant at or near the Martian surface than it is today.
PSP_004052_2045	This image covers an impact crater roughly 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) in diameter. The portion<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004052_2045_cut_b.jpg'> highlighted</a> shows a one kilometer segment of the crater wall and rim.<br><br>The surface outside the crater is relatively dark, while the interior wall of the crater exposes lighter, layered bedrock of diverse colors. A few dark patches on the crater wall have small dunes or ripples on their surfaces, and are likely pits filled with dark sand. The crater provides a window into the subsurface of Mars, revealing layered sedimentary deposits.<br><br>Just 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the east of this crater lies Mawrth Vallis, an ancient channel that may have been carved by catastrophic floods. In layered deposits surrounding Mawrth Vallis, the orbiting spectrometers OMEGA (on <a href='http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMUC75V9ED_0.html'>Mars Express</a>) and CRISM (on <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/'>MRO</a>) have detected phyllosilicate (clay) minerals, which must have formed in the presence of water. In this region on Mars, the colors of layers seen by HiRISE often correlate with distinct water-bearing minerals observed by CRISM, so the color diversity seen here may reflect a dynamic environment at this location on early Mars.<br><br>Note: the color in these images is enhanced; it is not as it would normally appear to the human eye.
PSP_004053_0940	This image shows a portion of the south polar permanent ice cap on Mars, which is composed of frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice). This slab of dry ice is a few meters (10-20 feet) thick and is peppered with quasi-circular pits. <br><br>The ice is very volatile in comparison to frozen water; it sublimates (evaporates directly from solid to gas) forming carbon dioxide gas when itís exposed to enough sunlight. The ice in this ice cap persists from year to year, yet observations by previous spacecraft have shown that the walls of the pits in this image are retreating by about 3 meters (10 feet) per year, eating away the slab of dry ice. These walls retreat rapidly because they are steeply sloping and absorb much more sunlight than adjacent flat surfaces (which show no changes).<br><br>This image is typical of surfaces in the south polar cap. The floors of these pits have only a thin covering of carbon dioxide ice, but the dry-ice mesasóthe adjacent flat-topped plateausóbetween the pits are a few meters thick. The upper surfaces of these mesas are covered in a network of ridges where previous cameras could not observe and may even be accumulating fresh ice each year.  This landscape is changing rapidly, so it is thought to be very geologically young; the layers visible in the pit walls probably record variations in the Martian climate over the last few decades. 
PSP_004054_1675	This image shows a mound of tilted, layered rocks exposed on the floor of Melas Chasma, the widest segment of the Valles Marineris canyon system. The portion shown above is roughly 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) wide.<br><br>At the <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004054_1675_cut_b.jpg'>bottom of the image</a> is a fairly smooth surface that exposes rock layers (1350 x 1134; 4 MB). From this perspective, the layers have a folded appearance. Short, bright ridges superposed on top of the rock layers are likely dunes or ripples composed of wind-blown particles.<br><br>The smooth surface ends at an abrupt north-facing cliff.  In the shadows of the cliff walls, more rock layers can be seen in cross section. Erosion by the wind has carved alcoves into the cliff face, from which dark fans of eroded material extend downslope to the north.<br><br>The materials making up the layers in Melas Chasma and other parts of Valles Marineris may be sediment laid down by winds or water, perhaps in ancient lakes.  Alternatively, they may be layers of volcanic ash. HiRISE images are providing new insight into their origin by revealing the layer structures at unprecedented scale.
PSP_004056_1735	This HiRISE image shows terrain west of the Martian volcano Arsia Mons, the southernmost of the three aligned giant volcanoes known as the Tharsis Montes. The summit of Arsia Mons rises almost 18 kilometers (11 miles) above Mars datum, about twice as high as Mt. Everest on the Earth.<br><br>This unusual terrain consists of irregular, raised knobs, many of which are linear. The origin of this texture is unclear; it has been proposed that these deposits are extensive landslide deposits or volatile-rich glacier-like deposits that have moved downslope from the volcano's upper flanks. In either case, the knobby texture gives the impression of a jumbled surface.<br><br>Covering the entire scene is a mantle of sedimentary material, most likely wind-blown dust.  Subtle bright and dark wind streaks are visible, indicating that the dominant wind direction is right-to-left (west to east; north is up in the image).  At full resolution, small slope streaks are evident around the edges of many of the high-relief knobs. These streaks may be avalanche scars where bright dust has been removed, exposing a darker subsurface layer.  Fine ripples, which are linear ridges of sediment shaped by the wind, are also evident on most knobs when viewed at full resolution.
PSP_004060_1440	PSP_004060_1440 shows a fresh, approximately 7.5 km diameter crater that resides in a larger crater in the southern hemisphere.<br><br>The crater shown here has very few craters superposed on it, which attests to its youth. It also has very steep slopes and a sharp rim; more evidence of its young age. Young, fresh craters are of interest on Mars because they help place constraints on the rate at which new impact craters and other young features have formed in recent times.<br><br>This fresh crater is particularly interesting because it contains gullies. Gullies are slope features that are proposed to require some amount of liquid water to form. The gullies must have formed after the crater did, which means that if liquid water was involved in the formation of these gullies, then it existed on the surface of Mars more recently. The existence of recent liquid water is especially important in terms of the search for life on Mars and its future exploration.<br><br>Several of the gullies show features such as terraces, discontinuous channels, and abandoned channels (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004060_1440_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 500 yards across. 2036 x 1770; 3 MB); all of which imply that more than one flow event occurred.  It is unknown whether or not such multiple flows would have been closely spaced in time. Terraces are thought to indicate past flow levels.  Discontinuous channels may represent some subsurface flow in addition to surface flow, or they may be channels that were once continuous that have since been filled in with wind-blown sediment and dust. The latter is the most likely in the subimage.  For example, see the discontinuous channel near the center; it appears to have sediment infilling it.  Abandoned channels are paths that fluid flowed through in the past before another flow took a different direction.
PSP_004060_2020	This HiRISE image shows several cratered cones near Hephaestus Fossae. The fossae are a network of troughs typically several hundred meters wide; parts of these troughs are visible at the edges of this image. These may be related to regional tectonic activity. <br><br>Several origins are possible for the cones. They could be volcanic: volcanic and tectonic activity are often coupled, and the cones bear some resemblance to small volcanoes on Earth called cinder cones. However, there are no obvious lava flows (often associated with cinder cones) in this field of view. The eruption could have been more explosive, producing only small fragments with no flows, but this is not certain. <br><br>There are alternate explanations for the cones. Pedestal craters form when material ejected from impact craters armors a layer which erodes elsewhere; this is an unlikely origin for the cones since there is no obvious trace of the ejecta around the cones. Mud volcanism can also produce cratered cones somewhat similar to these morphologically, and this has been suggested at other sites on Mars. 
PSP_004071_1425	PSP_004071_1425 shows mesas that are part of Gorgonum Chaos, a region of chaotic terrain, which is a jumble of mounds and mesas grouped together. Chaotic terrain is most commonly found in Mars near the sources of the gigantic outflow channels. Gorgonum Chaos is one of the few exceptions.<br><br>Some of the troughs between the mesas appear to have V-shaped bottoms; there is no obvious flat floor in between. Others have dunes running down their centers probably indicating flat floors. It is possible that the mesas were once connected and that something caused fractures in the original mesa's surface that were then preferentially eroded.  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004071_1425_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage</a> (approximately 1 kilometer across; 4000 x 4000, 15 MB) is of the far left side of the second trough from the bottom. The top left and bottom right are bordering mesa tops. Prominently displayed on the south (bottom) facing trough wall is a group of gullies that have a set of dark materials running across them. The materials are probably dunes, and they are on top of the gully channels indicating that they formed more recently.
PSP_004072_1845	HiRISE image PSP_004072_1845 shows the funnel-shaped terminus of Lethe Vallis, a winding channel in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars.<br><br>Lethe Vallis flows from southwest to northeast between two basins, Cerberus Palus and eastern Elysium Plantia. Where it empties into the latter, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004072_1845_cut_b.jpg'>the channel abruptly widens</a> (2322 x 2048; 5 MB). On the west side of this HiRISE image, Lethe Vallis is approximately 800 meters (0.5 miles) wide; on the east side, it is more than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) in width. As the fluid that carved the channel spread out, its erosive power diminished. Thus, where the channel is wider, it contains numerous high-standing mesas that are primarily composed of pre-existing material that was not fully eroded away.<br><br>The floor of Lethe Vallis is covered in solidified lava and blanketed by a thin layer of light-toned dust. The lava has a rough, ridged appearance where its surface buckled as it cooled, and a smoother polygonal texture where it was not significantly deformed. Interestingly, lava textures are visible high on the banks and terraces of the Lethe Vallis.  Farther away from the channel, the terrain is older and more heavily cratered.
PSP_004077_1325	Image PSP_004077_1325 shows the edge of a dark dune field on the floor of Proctor Crater, a 150 kilometer diameter crater in the southern highlands of Mars.<br><br>The dark dunes are composed of basaltic sand that has collected on the bottom of the crater. Dark dune slip faces (the steeper sides of the dunes) are located on the east side of the dunes and are believed to have formed in response to fall and winter westerly winds caused by geostrophic forces (winds balanced by Coriolis and pressure gradient forces). Superimposed on their surface are smaller secondary dunes that are commonly seen on terrestrial dunes of this size. <br><br>Many smaller and brighter bed forms, most likely small dunes or granule ripples, cover the substrate between the larger dark dunes as well as most of the floor of Proctor Crater. The dark dunes overlie the small bright bedforms indicating that they formed more recently. In several areas, however, the dark dunes appear to influence the orientation of the small bright dunes, possibly by wind flowing around the larger ones, suggesting that both dark and bright bedforms are coeval. The dunes in Proctor Crater may be active today, moving in response to Martian winds.
PSP_004078_2015	Image PSP_004078_2015 shows light-toned layered deposits along the floor of Becquerel Crater, an impact crater in Arabia Terra. The deposits consist of stacked, repeating layers which consistently appear to be only a few meters thick (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004078_2015_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 601 x 587; 344 KB). The surface of the deposits also appears to be cracked into blocks a meter or so in length.<br><br>Layered deposits, such as these, form from sediments once deposited within the crater. Possible origins for the sediments include windblown debris, volcanic ash falling from the sky, or sediments that accumulated in a lake on the crater floor. The regular thickness of the layers suggests that they were most likely deposited in a water environment or by wind in a cyclic process.<br><br>Some of the layering has a dark appearance that produces an alternating bright-dark ìzebraî banding. This may be the result of a thin surface layer of coarser and darker basalt sand collected on the more level surfaces, rather than indicating compositional differences in the eroded layered beds. Faults can also be seen displacing portions of the layered bed. An example of this can be seen just left of center in the bottom half of the subimage. The faulting indicates that the deposits have experienced disruption since their emplacement. 
PSP_004085_1420	This image shows groups of gullies at different elevations on the same crater wall. Although gullies are common in the mid-latitudes of Mars, they are rarely found to exist at such distinct elevations as seen here.<br><br>The mounds on the floor, one of which contains gullies, probably formed during a late stage of crater formation. Both levels of gullies appear to originate at layers. These layers might be ice-rich, or they might be capable of conducting water to the surface.<br><br>The gullies visible here are good candidates for formation by subsurface water, as opposed to melting ice or snow originating on the surface. The rounded, theater-shaped alcove and tributary heads (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004085_1420_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 140 meters across; 550 x 1018; 1.6MB) are typical of features formed by groundwater sapping on Earth. Surface runoff does not form this morphology.  <br><br>This image contains possible evidence of subsurface piping, when soil pores connect to form a "pipe" that transports water. When piping occurs, water carries soil with it, leaving empty space beneath the surface. As this process continues, the overlying surface can no longer support itself, and it collapses to form a depression. Several depressions that could have formed this way are seen in this image (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004085_1420_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). The depressions are also directly upslope of more developed alcoves. They also originate at upslope layers, and might be examples of developing alcoves.
PSP_004091_1845	This HiRISE image shows an arcuate ridge in Terra Meridiani. The ridge is most likely a former streambed, now exposed in inverted relief; the wandering path is not expected for an exhumed fault or volcanic dyke. The stream that formed this ridge must have been ancient as the ridge is buried by brighter rocks, which are themselves very old, having been thickly deposited and then heavily eroded. <br><br>The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in the same region of Mars, and the rocks it has examined are likely part of a sequence similar to that exposed here. The rocks exposed at the Opportunity landing site are mostly aeolian (wind-deposited) sandstone, but show evidence of past water, reaching the surface at times. Opportunity has access to only a few meters of a stack of sediments that is hundreds of meters thick. <br><br>Since water was present at times at the Opportunity landing site, surface water elsewhere in the sequence of sediments is perhaps not too surprising.  However, evidence like this may indicate that sediments were deposited by a broader range of processes than just those inferred at the Opportunity site. This is important for unraveling the entire history of the region. <br><br>A stream channel could become inverted in several ways. Chemicals precipitating from the water could bind the streambed together, lava could fill the channel, or the bed could contain large boulders. In each case, the relatively resistant material of the stream channel could remain as the surrounding rock eroded. Here, the ridge is distant from any volcanic vent, and appears fractured, particularly in the southern portion. This indicates that the ridge material is consolidated and has some strength. Thus, the most likely mechanism for formation of this ridge is deposition of a chemical "cement" which hardened the streambed rock. <br><br>The plains surrounding the ridge are also fractured, indicating some degree of consolidation. These cracks could form by desiccation (water loss) from wet sediment or tensile fracturing as the weight of overlying rocks was removed. Cracks like this can also form in permafrost due to seasonal temperature changes; ground ice is unlikely this close to the equator, but it is possible that the cracks are a remnant of different climate conditions from the past.
PSP_004097_2185	This HiRISE image shows a section of Arcadia Planitia, part of the northern plains of Mars. The plains are extremely smooth at large scale. As seen here, they are knobby and rough up close. The surface texture is likely related to several processes involving subsurface ground ice. <br><br>Sublimation (a direct transition from ice to gas, without melting to form liquid water) may be partly responsible; large parts of the Martian mid-latitudes have been mantled with a layer believed to be icy dust. This ice is now being lost in the current dry climate causing the ground to collapse slightly, leaving behind a knobby surface. <br><br>Another indication of icy ground is the array of cracks found in several parts of the image. These cracks are due to seasonal thermal contraction of frozen ground, creating stresses that fracture the surface. The cracks can form geometric patterns that interact with topography. Such fracture patterns are one of the most common landform in permafrost on Earth. There are also a few large, enigmatic mounds which may be ice-related; these are currently being studied by the HiRISE team. 
PSP_004120_2010	This HiRISE image samples the floor of Kasei Valles, a pair of giant channels north of Valles Marineris.  <br><br>This image is near the source of the southern of the two channels. It shows a surface covered with large plates that are covered with ridges. This kind of "platy-ridged" surface is found on many of the young plains on Mars and on large lava flows in Iceland. The ridges form as the surface of the lava flow hardens as it cools and is crumpled during flow.  The plates form as large pieces of this crust raft apart.
PSP_004168_1220	Marked by large depressions in the mantle, this observation shows an area south of the Hellas region in the southern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>The large depressions have scalloped edges and appear to have formed from multiple smaller depressions, also with scalloped edges, that have coalesced together. Scalloped pits such as these are typical features of the mid-latitude mantle and are most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees north and south latitude. The presence of scalloped pits has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (the process of solid material going directly to a gaseous state). <br><br>Scalloped pits, such as these, typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>The formation of some scalloped depressions is believed to be an ongoing process today.<br><br>On the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions are multiple criss-crossing dark streaks; these are formed by dust devils. Dust devils are spinning, columnar vortices of wind that commonly occur in dry and desert landscapes on Earth as well as Mars. They move across the landscape leaving a dark streak by removing bright dust from the terrain in their path and revealing a darker surface underneath. Some of the dark streaks in this image cross the depressions indicating that dust devils have been active since the formation of the depressions.
PSP_004230_1080	Covered by seasonal carbon dioxide (CO2) frost, the dune field here in Richardson Crater has only partially defrosted, although the image was acquired late in Mars' southern spring. <br><br>Large patches of CO2 frost are observed, linked in some places by channels possibly carved into the ground by the erosion of CO2 gas, as blocks dry ice slide down slope and sublimate (evaporate directly from solid to gas).  Numerous dust devil tracks have left their mark. 
PSP_004233_1980	HiRISE image of a proposed landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) in Isidis Basin Escarp.
PSP_004242_1495	PSP_004242_1495 shows a central peak of a large, degraded impact crater in the Terra Sirenum region of the southern hemisphere. Central peaks form during crater formation when a particularly large impactor hits the surface.<br><br>The central peak visible here (about 2/3 of the way down the image) is interesting because it has some fluvial-like features on its south  side. At lower resolution, these features appear to be channels with some connecting pits.  At higher resolution (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004242_1495_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, approximately 500 meters across; 2000 x 3000, 6MB), the features appear to be troughs that are filled with dunes. <br><br>What is most interesting is the chain of pits that extends down the center of some of the troughs as seen in the subimage. It is possible that these pits are evidence of subsurface piping or hydrothermal activity.  Piping occurs when subsurface water flows through soil, takes some soil with it, and causes the overlying ground to collapse. These fluvial-like features and the connected pits may have formed during a late stage of crater formation when temperatures were suitable for liquid water.
PSP_004266_1385	One of the most well-known valley networks on Mars is Warrego Valles. Located along the southern boundary of the Thaumasia Plateau in the southern highlands, images of these valley systems are often used in textbooks or online as evidence for a more Earth-like climate on early Mars.<br><br>At least before the HiRISE era, whenever a single image illustrating "water on Mars" was needed, a Viking-era image of Warrego answered the call. Despite its fame, the origin of the Warrego valley networks has never been fully understood.<br><br>At first glance, these ancient (several billion years old) valley systems seem similar to erosional networks on Earth, but they are simpler and not as finely integrated. In addition, they are only located in one area on the plateau boundary. Valleys have not formed all along the plateau boundary as might be expected from rainfall (Gulick, 2001, Geomorphology, pgs. 241-268). Nevertheless many have argued that these features attest to an ancient warmer, wetter time of Mars' geological history.To better understand the Warrego valleys, HiRISE imaged the headwater regions of one of the tributaries.  <br><br>Seen at high resolution the system appears more complex than implied by the much lower resolution Viking-era images.  The valley floor&mdash;as well as the floors of nearby small craters&mdash;is covered by an enigmatic rough, angular, blocky textured material that seems to be contained in a finer-grained material. This rough textured material might also be the result of ice evaporating from the subsurface.<br><br>At any rate at HiRISE resolution, there is little sign of fluvial bedforms, like channel bars, from the original erosive event that carved the valleys. Given the age of these valleys, clues to its origin may long since have been obscured by subsequent geologic processes. Without such geologic clues we can add little more to the previous speculation about what might have carved these features originally. In this case, the high resolution images provided by HiRISE inform us that we have much more to learn about some of the best known landforms on Mars.<br><br>
PSP_004274_1225	Image PSP_004274_1225 is located on the northwestern flank of the volcano Peneus Patera, southwest of Hellas Basin.<br><br>The terrain consists of a rough, pitted lower surface and a relatively, smooth upper surface. The lower surface forms oval- to scalloped-shaped edge depressions, several of which have coalesced together. Typically these depressions have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. The pitted texture of this lower terrain may have formed by the removal of subsurface ice by sublimation, as at this latitude on Mars, the pressure and temperature conditions allow interstitial ground ice to sublime, possibly leading to the formation of depressions. <br><br>For example, the roughly circular feature at the top of the image was probably an ancient crater that was filled with the smooth material, possibly composed of ash and dust mixed with interstitial ice. Sublimation of this material subsequently occurred following the crater rim, leaving this circular pattern.
PSP_004275_1275	Hellespontus is one of the regions on Mars where dust storms have often been seen to start. Winds have picked up dust which has then become trapped on the broad crater floors of the region. <br><br>Large quantities of dark sand <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004275_1275_cut_b.jpg'>form beautiful features on the surface.</a> This example is in a crater at 23E, 52S.  At HiRISE resolution these features also show sinuous flows which are distinctly different in morphology from slope streaks. The latter are probably the result of gravity-induced slippage.<br><br>It is unknown whether these flows are currently active or what the material is that initiates the flow. Although the dune fields are at high southern latitude, the very dark surface makes them strongly absorbant and therefore warm in the Martian summer. Hence, water is a possible candidate but this remains to be investigated.
PSP_004277_1530	This image covers a portion of the rim of  Holden crater, revealing  breaches created when water over-topped the rim and incised a series of channels as it flowed down the crater wall. The water responsible for the channels was impounded outside of the rim of Holden in Uzboi Vallis. (Holden Crater itself is approximately 150 kilometers in diameter.)<br><br>Uzboi Vallis was interrupted when Holden crater formed and the rim formed an effective, temporary damn to flow farther to the north. Once the Uzboi basin filled, water began flowing into Holden again, creating a series of low fan-shaped deltas, alluvial deposits, and a shallow, but relatively short-lived lake. <br><br>The channels in this image were only active for a short time, as a channel just to the east cut quickly into the rim and became responsible for most of the drainage into the crater. The fact that most of the fan-shaped deltas radiate from the dominant channel to the east rather than those in this image supports this scenario.  
PSP_004278_1715	One of the unresolved questions by scientists studying the Valles Marineris canyon system concerns the relative ages of light-toned and dark-toned layered deposits inside the canyon troughs. <br><br>Some scientists argue that the light-toned layered deposits are relatively young units that were deposited on top of older dark-toned layered deposits after formation of the troughs. Others favor the idea that the light-toned layered deposits are exhumed from the wallrock by trough formation and were formed concurrently with the dark-toned deposits. <br><br>The dark-toned layered deposits define the wallrock of Valles Marineris system and have been interpreted primarily as volcanic lavas, sedimentary rocks, and/or layered intrusive rocks. The light-toned layered deposits could be volcanic ash, aeolian deposits, and/or sedimentary rocks possibly deposited in water.  <br><br>By examining locations where light- and dark-toned layered deposits share a geologic contact, such as this image in East Candor Chasma, scientists hope to determine the relative ages of the two units. Near the bottom of the image, dark-toned layered deposits are exposed on spurs with dark debris aprons along the steeper canyon walls. The light-toned layered deposits are seen to the north along the trough floor.
PSP_004285_1375	This HiRISE image is of a region east of the Hellas impact basin and south of Reull Vallis.  Unexpectedly, HiRISE caught a dust devil blowing across the Martian surface in the southwest portion of the image.  <br><br>Dust devils form when the temperature of the atmosphere near the ground is much warmer than that above. The hot air rises, and under ideal conditions, forms a vortex that sucks in more warm air. If the vortex is strong enough, it will raise dust off the surface, forming a dust devil. <br><br>Dust devils generally form in the afternoon because the sunlight needs sufficient time to warm the surface. When this image was taken, the local time was about 3:08 p.m. In addition to the main image, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004285_1375_cut_arrow.jpg'>we show here a small version of the HiRISE image with an arrow</a> showing the location of the dust devil (364 x 800; 284 KB). The third subimage shows the <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004285_1375_cut_b.jpg'>dust devil close up</a> (1294 x 822; 1 MB).  <br><br>The bright material is the dust within the vortex, and a dark shadow cast by the dust devil is visible to the right. The diameter of this dust devil is about 200 meters, but at the surface it is probably much smaller. Based on the length of the shadow in this image, the dust devil is on the order of 500 meters tall.
PSP_004289_1780	This image shows tracks left by the MER Rover Opportunity as it traversed around the rim of Victoria Crater over the past nine months. <br><br>The rover's tracks <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004289_1780_cut_b.jpg'>can be seen as faint parallel lines</a> punctuated by dots where the rover stopped to perform scientific investigations or turned for course corrections or to facilitate communications (1792 x 877, 1.5 MB). The oldest tracks date from September 2006, and extend from the upper left corner of the image to an embayment called Duck Bay. Opportunity then travelled eastwards along the north rim of Victoria, pausing at many of the crater promontories to examine the layered rocks exposed in the cliffs.<br><br>In early April 2007, Opportunity crossed a pair of active wind streaks near the eastern end of the image, leaving bright tracks in the dark wind streaks. Scientists hope to monitor the erasure of rover tracks over time as a way to gauge the activity of wind streaks. Opportunity reached the furthest eastward point of the nine-month traverse on 28 April 2007. The rover performed a test of autonomous driving software at this location that produced an arcuate track, and then quickly drove back towards Duck Bay, keeping far from the crater rim. The Opportunity rover can be seen just to the north of Duck Bay, where it will attempt to enter into the crater.
PSP_004306_1980	This image covers a small volcano found in the Tharsis province of Mars. Tharsis is best known as the home of many of Mars' giant shield volcanoes.<br><br>However, between the enormous edifices are vast sheet-like lava flows and many smaller volcanic features. This small volcano is the source of many lava flows extending away in all directions. The central pits probably contained lava lakes when the volcano was active. Much of the lava in the lakes would have drained out the prominent channel that extends northward.  
PSP_004310_1445	Image PSP_004310_1445 shows part of the central peak of Martz Crater in Terra Cimmeria. This crater is almost 100 kilometers (60 miles) in diameter and approximately 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) deep. For a different view, <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/m07_m12/images/M08/M0806391.html'>see this Mars Orbital Camera wide angle image</a>. <br><br>Its very prominent and steep central peak (1500 meters or 5000 feet tall) formed at the same time as the crater, due to rebound right after a large object (approximately 8 kilometers, or 5 miles, across), impacted the surface. Central peaks are common in large, relatively young craters; those in older craters are masked by erosion and infill.<br><br>The HiRISE image shows gullies in south-facing walls of the central peak. These gullies have alcoves, braided channels, and well developed terminal debris aprons; they seem to originate at different heights in the walls. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004310_1445_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage shows</a> some of these gullies in detail; illumination is from the left, downhill is down (approximately 290 x 200 m or 320 x 220 yards; 1162 x 789, 1MB). The walls of some of these gullies have polygons similar to features observed in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica. Antarctica's polygons are produced by repeated expansion and contraction of subsurface soil and ice, due to seasonal temperature oscillations.<br><br>The gullies shown here are very similar to gullies observed on the walls of craters elsewhere on Mars. However, gullies in central peaks and some gullies on crater walls may have formed due to different processes. Current leading hypotheses for the origin of gullies in central peaks include: accumulation of snow followed by melting and runoff; impact-induced atmospheric precipitation; surface runoff of water released from the subsurface during impact; tapping into a deep aquifer, and dry landslides. <br><br>Other intriguing features in this crater are the wide, branching channels shown in the southern half of this HiRISE image. Their dramatic appearance is due to the contrast between dark wind-blown materials and their brighter surroundings.
PSP_004311_1050	This full HiRISE image shows layers exposed on the scarp that bounds the south polar layered deposits. These deposits make up a geologic unit of layered water ice, containing a small amount of dust. The different ice layers are thought to record varying climatic conditions in the history of Mars, in much the same way that layers within ice-sheets on the Earth can tell us about how our own climate has changed.<br><br>The top of this scarp is near the top/left of the image and is about 800 meters (half a mile) above the bottom, although only the lower 560 meters (1840 feet) is shown here. Near the bottom of the scarp, the icy layers have a disrupted, irregular appearance. This irregular wavy appearance may have been caused by the flow of  ice at some point, although it is currently too cold on Mars for significant flow to be occurring today.<br><br>Layers near the top of the image appear to be converging and some of the lower layers appear truncated. Geologists call this an unconformity, as it indicates that there was a previous episode of erosion that removed material down to the truncated layers. Subsequent deposition then built this stack of ice back up to its current thickness. Features like this, as well as the layers themselves, can help planetary scientists figure out what past climates on Mars may have been like.
PSP_004313_1760	This fresh, approximately 1 kilometer diameter impact crater was targeted after examinations of temperature images derived from the <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'>Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS).</a> The brightness temperature image revealed that the crater is very distinctive, exhibiting a bright, warm ejecta blanket suggesting that it is ìrockierî than the surrounding sands and dust of Syrtis Major.<br><br>This caption describes two images that form a stereo-pair, that is often useful to study the same area at different times and to note any differences for further examination. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/winslow_changes.gif'>This animated image</a> demonstrates the principle of having a stereo-pair.<br><br>In the first HiRISE image of Winslow Crater (PSP_004313_1760), <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_004313_1760_cut_b.jpg'>distinct dark rays surrounding the crater</a> and are consistent with the THEMIS dataís suggestion of rockier materials. V-shaped patterns in the rays ó referred to as a ìherringboneî pattern ó are identical to those around fresh lunar craters. These form when materials are ejected from the crater at a very low angle, which form clusters of secondary craters that preferentially eject materials down-range in a V-shaped pattern. (Itës the same pattern that you would get when shooting a water pistol nearly parallel to a sidewalk.)<br><br>Also noteworthy are the large meter-to-decimeter-sized boulders on the  steep rim that have not been buried or physically weathered to smaller sizes in this windy region, indicating that they have not been exposed long. This is also reminiscent of Meteor Crater and examples of fresh simple craters on the Moon.<br><br>The ring of rocky, cliff-forming materials in the inner wall of the crater represents original bedrock that was uplifted and exposed by the impact. The characteristic morphology is called ìspur and gullyî consisting of both the protruding bedrock inter-fingered with debris shoots feeding fans of sandy materials that extend down to the crater floor. Throughout this region, the present-day surface consists of a mix of global dust and volcanic sands from the Syrtis Major complex that typically cover the local bedrock. Winslow Crater is an excellent example of how craters can provide a window into the subsurface by exposing the local bedrock within the ejecta and crater wall.<br><br><strong>Second Image</strong><br>Later, a second HiRISE image of Winslow (<a href='/PSP_005658_1760'> PSP_005658_1760</a>) was <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005658_1760_cut_b.jpg'>taken to obtain a stereo-pair</a> useful for determining the relief and topography of the crater and its surroundings. By chance this second image was taken after the dust storm that enveloped the planet in June 2007. Dust deposited during this storm blanketed the region and largely obscured the brightness differences between the dark rays and the surrounding bright soil. Laboratory experiments on natural surfaces indicate that a layer of dust only a few tens of microns thick is sufficient to achieve such obscuration. The thin dark lines that cross the later image show that dust-devils have already begun the work of cleansing the surface of dust and restoring the region to its previous appearance. <br><br><strong>Naming the Crater</strong><br>Due to its similar size and remote thermal infrared (TIR) characteristics similar to Meteor Crater, Arizona, the name Winslow Crater was suggested after the small town roughly 20 km to the east of Meteor Crater, and the International Astronomical Unionís committee on Planetary Nomenclature agreed. (For further information on Planetary Nomenclature <a href='http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/'>click here</a>).
PSP_004315_1815	This region of eastern Meridiani shows a fairly smooth texture where we can see the filling-in of small craters with aeolian (wind deposited) sand.<br><br>The sand is likely basaltic in origin. Some of the sand blown by the wind has eroded the local terrain, whereas other deposits have become trapped within small craters. The bedrock contains phyllosilicates (clay minerals), which form in the presence of water. Phyllosilicates have been detected in higher concentrations in other areas of Mars such as Mawrth Vallis and Nili Fossae, but detections of lesser abundance have been noticed in Meridiani as well. 
PSP_004324_1060	This image shows an exposure of south polar layered deposits, thought to record recent global climate changes on Mars.<br><br>The layers were probably laid down over the past few million years over a large area near the south pole, then eroded to show the layering visible in this image. The layers appear brighter where their slopes are steeper and facing the sun.<br><br>Within the brighter, steeper part of the layered deposits, a network of polygonal fractures is visible. The polygons outlined by the fractures are typically a few hundred meters (approximately 1000 feet) across, and traverse layer boundaries. Such polygonal fractures are seen on Earth in places where ground ice is present, and previous Mars orbiters have found evidence for abundant ground ice in the south polar region of Mars. So it is not surprising to see polygonal fractures here; what is unusual is that they cross layer boundaries, apparently unaffected by the changes in slope across them.<br><br>This suggests that the polygonal fractures formed after the scarp exposing the south polar layered deposits was formed by erosion. This indicates, possibly, that the scarp has been stable for some time, allowing the polygonal fractures to form.
PSP_004340_1235	This region shown here is located on the northwest flanks of the volcano Peneus Patera, itself located in the southwest area of Hellas Basin. <br><br>It is covered by a layer of relatively smooth material, possibly made of ashes and dust mixed with interstitial ice. This layer covers a more ancient surface and partly buries craters up to  tens of kilometers wide. The image shows residual parts of the layer. Erosion has exposed lower terrains with a rougher pitted texture. <br><br>Several areas are crossed by a network of cracks forming polygons. These features are similar to permafrost (permanently frozen) polygons that form in periglacial regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil. They are indicative of the presence of ground ice, so it is likely that the landforms we observe here are related to the presence of interstitial ice in the subsurface.  (Periglacial means occurring or operating adjacent to the margin of  a glacier.)<br><br>The erosional process of these terrains starts with the development of oval- to scalloped-shaped depressions that typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. Several of these depressions may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. <br><br>The texture of these terrains suggests that the main formation process is sublimation, which is the process of a material going directly from a solid state to a gaseous state. At this latitude on Mars, the conditions of pressure and temperature allow water ice within the ground to sublime. The disappearance of the ice component of the ground probably leads to the formation of depressions. This process may still be active today.
PSP_004350_1080	The global dust storm of 2007 obscured most of the surface of Mars for several weeks, making it difficult for HiRISE to image targets of interest. <br><br>This image is an example of those that were spoiled by dust in the Martian atmosphere during the storm. 
PSP_004353_0935	A dust storm has been raging on Mars, hampering the ability of the HiRISE team to carry out a seasonal monitoring campaign.<br><br>An area of the southern seasonal polar cap was selected in December 2006 for repeated imaging, to observe the sublimation (evaporation) of the seasonal carbon dioxide polar cap through southern spring. Images collected as the season progressed show channels carved by escaping gas and fans of dust blown by the wind. This campaign has been stymied however by the arrival of a Martian dust storm. In this image the surface is completely obscured by the dust in the air.<br>
PSP_004383_1625	Just outside of Eos Chasma in eastern Valles Marineris is a unit of light-toned material on the plains. Plains on Mars are typically dark-toned and formed by the lava from volcanic eruptions.<br><br>One possibility for the light-toned nature of the plains in this image is a deposit other than lava. Compositional information from other instruments orbiting Mars, such as the CRISM spectrometer (also on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) could shed insight into what is causing the light-toned nature of this unit. <br><br>Many dark circular features in the light-toned deposit are impact craters that have been filled in with darker material, such as basalt sand. The dark-toned unit that surrounds the light-toned one has linear ripples not seen on the light-toned unit. If the dark-toned unit represents an aeolian deposit, then the light-toned unit in the image may be clean rock exposures not yet covered by this aeolian (wind created) material. In this second possibility, the reason the unit appears light-toned is simply because it is adjacent to an even darker unit, but compared to other lava plains on Mars, the light-toned unit may not be unusual.
PSP_004384_1705	This HiRISE image covers a portion of the wallrock and canyon floor in southwestern Melas Chasma. <br><br>Along the floor of Melas Chasma is an unusual blocky deposit composed of light-toned blocks in a darker matrix. The high-resolution of the HiRISE image reveals layers only a few meters thick in some of the light-toned blocks. The blocks vary in size but most fall between 100-500 meters in diameter. <br><br>Although most blocks appear rounded, others have angular edges and can be very elongate. The morphologies of the blocks suggest ductile deformation, such as from a flow or by tectonic disruption after emplacement. Aeolian ripples are interspersed between the blocks in the darker matrix. <br><br>Small valleys can be seen along the wallrock to the south. The wallrock is a mixture of two geologic units that differ mainly in their reflectance. The light-toned unit appears to be thinner and only exposed in localized spots. Several of the light-toned deposits are seen only in the valleys, suggesting they were either deposited or are exposed by erosion.
PSP_004390_1035	The global dust storm of 2007 obscured most of the surface of Mars for several weeks, making it difficult for HiRISE to image targets of interest. <br><br>This image is an example of those that were spoiled by dust in the Martian atmosphere during the storm. <br><br>
PSP_004412_1715	This image covers a pit in the lower west flank of Arsia Mons, one of the four giant volcanos of the Tharsis region.<br><br>Many layers are exposed in the pit, probably marking individual lava flows, and provide information about the nature of the volcanic eruptions. This image was acquired in the middle of large regional dust storms on Mars, but the atmosphere over this image is only moderately dusty because the altitude is 6.5 kilometers higher than the planetary mean, so the air is quite thin and cannot hold as much dust.<br><br>Although the atmosphere is not too dusty, the surface is buried by a dust layer meters thick.  These high-altitude locations on Mars have thick dust deposits because the thin air cannot blow away the dust, or at least not as fast as it accumulates. On Earth the oceans serve as dust traps, but on Mars, it is the high volcanos.
PSP_004421_1850	Crommlin Crater is a little over 100 kilometers (62 miles) across and contains a mound of layered rock deposits. Layering in geologic materials is interesting because it represents a record of deposition over time. By studying such layered sequences, scientists attempt to tell what the local climate and environment were like in the past.<br><br>This image runs along the eastern side of the layered mound within the crater. Upslope is to the west, to the left of the image, and downslope is to the east, to the right of the image. Along the slope of the mound, the layered exposures are visible. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004421_1850_cut_b.jpg'>subimage included here</a> (approximately 1.7 kilometers or 1.1 miles across; 1750 x 1439, 2 MB) shows an area with a sequence of layers that is very regular, like looking at the pages of a book edge on, or at the layers in a slice of cake from the side. Presumably these layers were once more continuous, perhaps reaching all the way to the crater wall (off-image to the right), and were then cut into by erosion so that we now see the layer edges. <br><br>Further upslope, to the left, are knobs, mesas, terraces, and other indications that layers also exist here, but were eroded in a more irregular manner. Unfortunately, the finest layering and details are not visible because the Martian atmosphere above Crommlin Crater at this time was dusty, making a clear image difficult for the HiRISE camera to obtain. Within the regular sequence of layering, however, a pattern of several fine layers separated by single thicker, or darker, layers are apparent. This repeating pattern may indicate that the conditions in which the sediments were originally deposited repeated over time.<br><br>Crommlin Crater is especially interesting because it is located very close to Meridiani Planum, which is where the MER Opportunity Rover has been exploring layered rocks up close. Comparison of nearby layers studied from the rover on the ground and from the spacecraft above will provide greater insight into the age and origin of these deposits.
PSP_004423_1755	PSP_004423_1755 shows plains north of the southwestern Juventae Chasma, a canyon part of the gigantic Valles Marineris system.<br><br>There are three distinct terrains in this image, plains with possible inverted channels, plains with exposed layers, and layers on a wall of Juventae Chasma.<br><br>The top half of the image contains plains with craters and sinuous ridge features that are possibly inverted stream channels. Inverted relief occurs when a formerly low-lying area becomes high-standing. There are several possible reasons why channels might stand out in inverted relief. The streambed material may become cemented by precipating minerals, contain larger rocks, or become filled with lava, all which are more resistant to erosion. Finer-grained, more erodable material surrounding the channel is blown away by the wind or carried away by water, leaving the resistant channel bed high and dry around its environs.<br><br>Another example of erosion can be seen <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004423_1755_cut_b.jpg'>in the next terrain</a> which covers about 2/3 of the bottom half of the image (4000 x 6000, 23MB). Erosion has exposed a beautiful series of light and dark tone layers (approximately 1 kilometer across). In the subimage, the smallest of the rings is the deepest exposed layer.  Layers are common in the Martian canyons, but it is unknown what process formed them. It is likely that the layers in the plains here are made of the same material as the layer in the canyons.
PSP_004434_1885	This HiRISE image shows part of an extensive series of layered materials in a crater in Arabia Terra. The crater is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) in diameter and mostly filled with layered rocks, which are common throughout the area. <br><br>This image covers a swath of the crater from the center to the rim; the rim is at the northern edge (top). The northernmost layered materials are exposed as small buttes and stacks of layers, forming circular or elongated knobs. Further south, the appearance of the layers changes, forming more expansive outcrops with a few small knobs. This could be due to a change in the properties of the layers at given levels of the crater; materials of various strengths may erode at different rates. It might also reflect local slopes or erosional processes. This area looks darker-toned from a distance, but this appears to be due to partial covering of some of the layers by dark sand. A large sheet of sand is visible at the southern (bottom) edge of the image. <br><br>Many small faults are visible throughout the layers, expressed as small discontinuities and offsets; these indicate places where tectonic stresses have caused the layered deposits to break and shift. <br><br>The origin of such layers is not certain. Materials a few hundred kilometers away have been explored by <a href='http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/'>NASA's Opportunity rover,</a> and are sandstone formed by ancient dunes; the same could be true at this site, as sandstone on Earth often forms extensive layered deposits. Other possibilities include ancient lake or ocean sediments or volcanic airfall deposits. It is possible that multiple processes contributed to the rocks here, but the regularity of layering suggests a single repeated process.

PSP_004650_0975	Extensive layered deposits are found in both polar regions of Mars, and are thought to contain evidence of recent climate changes like ice ages on Earth.<br><br>Radar observations suggest that the polar layered deposits are composed mostly of water ice, but many layered exposures, including this one, appear to be covered by a layer of dust that protects the underlying water ice from further erosion.  The south polar layered deposits are more extensive than the northern deposits, and have generally been less active recently.<br><br>The greater age of the surface of the south polar layered deposits is indicated by the higher density of craters on its surface; a cluster of small craters <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_004600_004699/PSP_004650_0975/PSP_004650_0975_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>is visible above center in this image.</strong></a> Also visible are widespread polygonal fractures, evidence of water ice expansion/contraction below the surface.  
PSP_004664_0955	This image spans a section of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). The SPLD are composed of layers of water ice mixed with impurities (probably mostly dust). The most similar terrestrial analog to the SPLD are ice sheets, like those covering most of Greenland and Antarctica.<br><br>The materials of ice sheets are deposited by freezing of atmospheric water vapor on dust particles and precipitation of those water/dust particles (snow), by direct condensation (freezing) of atmospheric water vapor onto the surface, and by fallout of dust. Together, these processes cause an ice sheet to undergo accumulation (build-up). Ablation (removal of material, also called erosion) of an ice sheet can also occur. If more accumulation happens than ablation, the ice sheet grows; if reversed, the ice sheet shrinks, as is the case for many of Earthís glaciers due to global warming. Each year, the amount of accumulation and ablation varies, so layers of different thicknesses and different amounts of impurities (dust) will be deposited onto the ice sheet.<br><br>Volcanic eruptions anywhere on the planet can also potentially spew ash high into the atmosphere, where it can travel great distances and fall onto an ice sheet surface. Later accumulations of water ice can then trap this volcanic ash as a layer within the ice sheet. Thus, layers in an ice sheet can originate through a variety of means and occur at a variety of scales (thicknesses).   <br><br>This particular image is interesting because many layers are exposed and because more than one outcrop (exposure of layering) is visible&mdash;at the top of the image and at the bottom. You can imagine the outcrops at the top and bottom of the image as if you are looking down on a staircase. The approximately horizontal lines are the edges of the layers (the risers), and the flat areas between them are the layer surfaces (the flat parts of the steps). The middle of the image is the top of the staircase.  At the bottom, the staircase of layers goes down again.<br><br>The layers in this image are on the scale of meters (several to tens of feet) in thickness and are much thicker than one might expect from annual accumulation (which might be about 0.5 millimeters per year, or 0.02 inch per year). So the layers we see in this image may be packages of thinner, annual layers. The reason that we can distinguish between different packages of annual layers (in other words, the reason that we can see layering at this scale) is because the rates of accumulation and ablation change not only yearly, but also on much longer time scales. Imagine drilling into the SPLD and looking at the walls of the hole with a microscope. Within the large-scale layering we see in this image, we might see annual accumulation layers, dusty layers created during large dust storms, and maybe even volcanic ash layers.
PSP_004673_0935	Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles. Because Mars is so much colder however, carbon dioxide ice is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring, analogous to winter-time water ice/snow on Earth. <br><br>Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter; this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' north polar cap.<br><br>As can be seen in this HiRISE image of the south pole residual cap, relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions. This patterned terrain is called "swiss cheese" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses of several to approximately 10 meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of this carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). As most depressions seem to have relatively flat floors, there is likely some layer below, possibly made of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Complicated shapes arise when neighboring growing depressions intersect.<br><br>A previous Mars imaging system, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took images of the same places on the south pole residual cap every year for many years, and showed that there are annual changes taking place within it. By looking at different sizes and shapes of depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of "swiss cheese" terrain can be described. The sublimation process may begin as a small, shallow depression in a smooth surface. This depression then deepens until reaching the resistant layer below, and continues to expand laterally in all directions, creating the generally round depressions we see today. Different heights and thicknesses of smooth areas, and different depths of depressions, may indicate that multiple episodes of accumulation and sublimation have occurred.<br><br>This is one of the locations previously monitored at lower resolution by MOC. With the high resolution and repeat-imaging capability of HiRISE, we intend to continue monitoring and better measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. This is one of the locations specifically targeted by HiRISE for this purpose.<br><br>Knowing the amount and rate of carbon dioxide removal can give us a better idea of the role of carbon dioxide (the main component of the Martian atmosphere) in polar and atmospheric processes, of current environmental and climatic conditions, and of how Mars climate may be changing.<br><br>In HiRISE images such as this one, it is evident on the slopes of the large, especially high mesa just above the center of the image that the carbon dioxide-rich material may be constructed of several individual horizontal layers. However, it also appears that as erosion eats into the mesa, pieces of a stronger mesa surface layer break off and are left strewn on the mesa slopes, where they may give the appearance of layering.<br><br>An interesting feature in this HiRISE image is the crisscrossing network of faint ridges and troughs on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice.
PSP_004687_0930	As on Earth, the seasonal frost caps of Mars grow and recede each year. But seasonal frost on Mars is composed of carbon dioxide ice (also known as dry ice), not water ice as on our planet.<br><br>Near the south pole of Mars, the seasonal carbon dioxide frost never completely disappears, leaving a residual ice cap of carbon dioxide ice throughout the summer. This HiRISE image shows part of the south polar residual cap, with many shallow pits dubbed "Swiss cheese" terrain.  Because the sun is always low in the sky at this latitude, the steep walls of the pits receive more solar energy than the high-standing, flat areas between the pits. This causes the walls of the pits to retreat several meters per year as sunlight causes the carbon dioxide ice to evaporate directly to gas, a process called "sublimation."<br><br>In some depressions, ridges or blocks of material a couple of meters (several feet) across are visible at the base of the depression walls, likely fallen from the walls during the sublimation and retreat process. At this rate, the layer of carbon dioxide ice could completely disappear in about 100 years if not replenished.<br><br>
PSP_004708_1000	This image spans a section of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD).  The SPLD are composed of layers of water ice mixed with impurities (mostly dust). The most similar terrestrial analog to the SPLD are ice sheets, like those covering most of Greenland and Antarctica. <br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004708_1000_cut_b.jpg'>figure shown here</a> is a cutout of the full observation (1.8 kilometers across, or 1 mile; 1844 x 1078, 6 MB) showing a very interesting and somewhat rare feature: a fault. The fault is the thin, diagonal line that cuts through most of the image, from near the lower left corner to near the upper right corner. On each side of the fault, the layers that cross the fault are slightly off-set from one other; in other words, the layers don't line-up with each other anymore. The relationship between the angles at which the layers and fault are exposed and the movement along the fault is complex, but, in general, the layers on the left side of the fault are slightly lower than those on the right.  <br><br>Faults are created when rock (or, in this case, water ice) breaks due to some outside force and rocks (or ice) along either side of that break move in opposite directions. One of the most famous faults on Earth is the San Andreas Fault in California. There is a crack between the floor of the Pacific Ocean, plus a little bit of the California and Mexico coastline, and the rest of North America; the Pacific Ocean floor is moving northward along that crack, but North America is moving southward. Because the two sides are grinding against each other, they sometime stick together and then move again in jerky fashion, much like the way if you try to rub pieces of rough sand paper together. When movement along the fault occurs after a period of sticking together, this creates an earthquake.<br><br>For the case of this fault on Mars, it is unlikely that a "Marsquake" occurred when movement happened along this fault, because it is so small (over 1000 times shorter than the San Andreas Fault). This is interesting because faults are rare in the Martian polar layered deposits. The fault may have been created during widespread flow of the SPLD. Some of the stiffer ice could not flow and broke instead. Ice can only flow fast enough to create faults when it is relatively warm. Similarly, if you cool molasses enough, it becomes hard and doesn't flow. But the temperatures on Mars today are probably not warm enough to allow the creation of faults. This is why faults are so rare in the Martian ice. When were temperatures warm enough? This is still a mystery.

PSP_004742_0990	The polar layered deposits on Mars are thought to be composed of varying amounts of water ice and dust. The variations in the relative amounts of ice and dust are probably caused by recent climate changes on Mars, similar to ice ages on Earth.<br><br>This image of the south polar layered deposits shows many layers, some of which are cut off or truncated against other layers (near the center of the image). These truncations are probably due to periods of erosion separating periods of deposition.<br><br>After nearly horizontal layers are deposited, they can be partly eroded (perhaps by winds) before more layers are deposited over them. In this image, there is evidence for at least two such episodes of erosion and burial. These types of observations are useful to Mars scientists as they try to unravel the climate history of Mars.
PSP_004748_0945	The south polar region of Mars contains numerous features dubbed "spiders." These are actually narrow shallow channels carved in the ground, probably by gas escaping as the seasonal dry ice cap sublimates (evaporates directly from solid ice to gas).<br><br>In the spring they are the source of fans of dust. In the summer, the dark fans are only barely discernible from the surface material, because they <strong>are</strong> the surface material.

PSP_004804_1105	Image PSP_004804_1105 shows the walls of a large pit inside Lyell Crater, near the south polar region.<br><br>This image was acquired during a period of elevated atmospheric dust, following a series of <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/dustmaps/'> dust storms </a> that encircled the planet; this is the cause of the longitudinal bands of contrasting gray levels in the image. We can still see through the thick atmosphere, though, gullies and other subtle features which could have been produced by water and ice present at or near the surface. <br><br>The gullies shown in <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004804_1105_cut_b.jpg'> the subimage</a>  (approximately 650 x 1000 meters or 710 x 1100 yards; 2618 x 4009 pixels, 11MB) have well developed alcoves, deeply incised channels, and large depositional fans, and are similar to terrestrial landscapes sculpted by surficial water.<br><br>The gullies shown in the subimage experienced several periods of activity, as evidenced by older channels cut by younger ones or by their deposits. The current and recent Martian temperatures and atmospheric conditions would not allow for water to be stable at the surface for extended periods of time: it is so cold that the water would freeze, and then it would sublime quickly, because the air is very thin and dry. These gullies could have formed under a different climate, or maybe by repeated bursts of transient fluids. Current leading hypotheses explaining the origin of gullies includes erosion from seepage or eruption of water from a subsurface aquifer, melting of ground ice, or dust-blanketed surface snow.<br><br>The otherwise subdued surface in this region is criss-crossed by numerous fissures, forming polygons some 10 meters (11 yards) across. Similar features in both shape and scale can be found in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica, where ice is present at or near the surface. Antarctica's features are the product of repeated expansion and contraction of the soil-ice mixture due to seasonal temperature oscillations. This results in polygonal networks of stress fractures.
PSP_004805_1710	The troughs and chasms of the Valles Marineris system contain light toned deposits of enigmatic origin. The light materials, often layered, have variously been proposed to be volcanic ash or sediments laid down by rivers, lakes or sand dunes. <br><br>One aspect of the light toned material that has remained unclear is the timing of its deposition relative to canyon formation--was the material deposited in the troughs, or does it crop out in the walls, indicating that it existed before the Valles Marineris system formed?<br><br>This HiRISE image shows a part of the wall of Ganges Chasma. (This image, taken during the major dust storms which have raged through the summer of 2007, is grainy and low-contrast because of dust in the atmosphere). The plateau above the chasm is at the bottom of the image, with the wall of the trough descending to the north. A few fine layers, likely basalt flows, form the cap layers. <br><br>In the spur at the center of the image, light material appears to crop out, contrasting with the relatively dark material elsewhere in the wall of the trough. At least some of this material is inherently lighter than other wall rock; changes in tone occur at several sites where there are no breaks in slope. The light material appears be forming spurs and ridges similar to the surrounding rock, suggesting that it comprises at least some part of the walls. However, darker, bouldery material occurs at the same level just to the west (left) of the light patch, indicating that the light outcrop may not extend very far. <br><br>Images like this provide clues to help unravel the history of deposition and deformation in Valles Marineris, and may eventually tell a complex story. In order to fully understand what this image means, several questions must be addressed: is this light material the same as intensively layered deposits observed elsewhere? How extensive are light wall materials? Are these materials conformable (part of a continuous sequence) with the rest of the wall? More HiRISE imaging will help address these questions.  
PSP_004820_0940	This image shows a portion of the south polar ice cap. The ice you see here is frozen carbon dioxide rather than the frozen water you are used to here on Earth. <br><br>Even on Mars, where the temperatures are much lower than on Earth, carbon dioxide ice is a volatile substance. As it is so unstable, large amounts can sublimate (change from a solid into a gas) very quickly when heated. In this ice cap we can see icy features shrink in size by several meters per year as the ice that makes them up is removed by solar heating. Usually these icy features are almost circular as you get equal amounts of sunlight from every direction when you are at the pole.<br><br>However, in this location something strange has happened. Instead of the usual circular features we see features that are decidedly linear in shape. These sets of linear features have been dubbed "fingerprint terrain" by planetary scientists. They are seen in several locations in this ice cap and usually have a wavelength close to 90 meters (295 feet). It's hard to understand why linear features would form in this sort of environment by sublimation of ice alone. It is possible that these features are formed instead by atmospheric processes. Either the features are sand dunes covered by a thin covering of frost or they might be made up of loose ice crystals that saltate like sand grains and have collected into ripples.<br><br>It would be a huge surprise to find sand dunes in this location, just as you wouldn't expect to see sand dunes on top of the Greenland ice sheet on Earth. To confirm that they are made of carbon dioxide ice, HiRISE will image this location again at the end of the year and compare it to this image to look for changes. Icy features should show large changes, but sand dunes move much more slowly.
PSP_004847_1745	Dark pits on some of the Martian volcanoes have been speculated to be entrances into caves. A <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003647_1745'>previous HiRISE image,</a> looking essentially straight down, saw only darkness in this pit. <br><br>This time the pit was imaged from the west. Since the picture was taken at about 2:30 p.m. local (Mars) time, the sun was also shining from the west. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004847_1745_cut_b.jpg'>We can now see the eastern wall</a> of the pit catching the sunlight.<br><br>This confirms that this pit is essentially a vertical shaft cut through the lava flows on the flank of the volcano. Such pits form on similar volcanoes in Hawaii and are called "pit craters." They generally do not connect to long open caverns but are the result of deep underground collapse. From the shadow of the rim cast onto the wall of the pit we can calculate that the pit is at least 178 meters (584 feet) deep. The pit is 150 x 157 meters (492 x 515 feet) across.  
PSP_004858_1670	This observation shows a landslide scarp on the northern wall of central Valles Marineris, a large canyon system equivalent in length from California to New York.  <br><br>The landslide has exposed a fresh wall of the canyon so that individual layers of rock can be seen. The texture of these layers suggests that some of the darker rock layers are more resistant to erosion than the lighter layers. The variation in brightness and friability of the different layers suggests compositional differences.  These layers may have a volcanic origin, having been deposited as ash layers, or a sedimentary origin, either being deposited by water or blown by the wind (aeolian).  <br><br>This image is a little hazy because this image was taken in August 2007, when the large dust storm covered the surface of Mars and filled the atmosphere with fine dust particles. The extra dust in the atmosphere reflects more light into the camera.  
PSP_004867_1220	This image captures an impact crater on the surface of Amphitrites Patera, an ancient volcano on the southern margin of the giant Hellas Basin. The Hellas Basin was formed by a very large impact into the southern highlands early in the geologic history of Mars.  The basin has a number of volcanoes along its margin, perhaps because magma could take advantage of the deep cracks in the crust that resulted from the impact.  <br><br>Amphitrites Patera is far enough south to approach the Martian "antarctic" and there is evidence for large amounts of ice in the ground. As in the polar regions of Earth, the icy ground (permafrost) is able to move and be modified by a variety of processes. In this case, the rim of the small impact crater is filled with a honeycomb of cracks. These are likely to have formed where dust- and soil-covered ice or ice cemented soil was cracked by thermal contraction in the winter. Subsequently, the underlying ice was able to escape into the atmosphere (sublimate) allowing the ground along the cracks to collapse. The only place where large boulders are visible is along the rim of the crater; this is probably where the boulders were not so deeply buried by the icy layer.   <br><br>The Martian atmosphere was dusty at the time this image was acquired, so small imperfections in the processing are very visible in the standard image products. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004867_1220_cut_b.jpg'>cutout was specially processed</a> to remove these artifacts.
PSP_004903_2050	PSP_004903_2050 captures the full western margin of the Elysium Mons caldera. A caldera is a feature that forms by the collapse of land after a volcanic eruption. This caldera is approximately 14 kilometers in diameter.   <br><br>Several pit crater chains can be observed radiating out from the caldera. These likely formed due to surface collapse from igneous dike intrusions and/or normal faulting. Some are very clear and pronounced, such as the one to the north of the caldera, and others are fainter, such as the ones at the bottom of the image, suggesting the lower ones have been subsequently covered by sediments, dust, or lava flows.
PSP_004917_1080	This section of the HiRISE image shows a scarp exposing the south polar layered deposits, with illumination from the lower right (scarp slopes toward bottom). The polar layered deposits probably contain a record of relatively recent climate changes on Mars, similar to ice ages on Earth.<br><br>The deposits appear to be composed mostly of water ice, with variations in dust content controlling the erosion of the layers. This image shows that the history of the south polar layered deposits has not been simple accumulation of horizontal layers.<br><br>Above and right of center, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004917_1080_cut_b.jpg'>the layers appear wavy</a> and in places, layers are cut off by other layers (2048 x 1633; 3.2MB). Such structures may be formed by flow or faulting, but in this case they are more likely to be due to erosion of the lower part of the layered deposits before the upper part was laid down over it. For example, deposition may have halted long enough for channels to be eroded into the layered deposits. When deposition resumes, new layers deposited in the channels could form the structures visible here. However, without more precise topographic information than is currently available, other hypotheses cannot be excluded.
PSP_004959_0865	This image shows the south polar layered deposits, with curving layer outcrops caused by erosion of valleys into the deposits.<br><br>On closer inspection, polygonal (mostly rectangular) fractures are visible, mostly near the center of the image. Polygonal fractures are also observed in the north polar layered deposits, but typically on a much smaller scale.<br><br>Here in the south, the fractures cross layer boundaries, while in the north the fractures are usually confined to a single layer. Therefore, the fractures in the south polar layered deposits formed after the surface was eroded to the configuration seen here, probably due to expansion and contraction of water ice below the surface.
PSP_004965_0980	The polar layered deposits (PLD) are interesting because they were probably formed by global climate changes on Mars, like ice ages on Earth. The PLD are rich in water ice, but appear to be covered by a dusty layer that protects the underlying ice from evaporation and erosion.<br><br>The exposure of south polar layered deposits <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004965_0980_cut_b.jpg'>shown here</a> also appears to be partly covered by additional debris, as layering is obscured at the left side of the subimage.  The layers appear to have been offset by a fault near the lower right corner. The faulting and burial visible here complicates the interpretation of the climate history of Mars based on observations of layering.
PSP_004976_0940	Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles.

PSP_004980_1035	<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004980_1035_cut_b.jpg'>This HiRISE subimage</a> shows (at reduced resolution; 2196 x 1442; 3 MB) a circular structure near the south pole of Mars. This feature is probably a heavily modified impact crater. It is currently expressed as a group of concentric circular features with little vertical expression. <br><br>This feature was probably once an impact crater many tens of meters deep. (Small impact craters are typically about one-fifth as deep as they are wide). The original topography has been smoothed by some combination of burial and viscous relaxation. Most burial processes will preferentially fill in low areas like craters; the infilling material may then compact, producing arcuate structures. <br><br>Creep of the crater wall material may have also played a role in erasing the crater. This far south, the surface material is likely to be ice-rich and will slowly flow downhill. Additional evidence for near-surface ice is provided by the pervasive polygons in the image, forming due to stresses caused by temperature variations in ice-rich ground. <br><br>Regardless of the mechanism, the crater remains faintly expressed in the surface morphology. Note that the surface has a similar texture away from the crater, but not organized into concentric arcs. The residual structure of the crater provides some control on stresses, producing the ringed pattern.
PSP_004981_1435	This observation shows the remnants of a thick deposit that once covered much of the Electris region of Mars.<br><br>The deposit is generally bland in appearance, but shows subtle indications of layering. Where exposed along scarps, the deposit appears to be uniformly fine-grained and yields little in the way of blocky talus (rock debris) upon erosion. The origin of this deposit remains uncertain, but the fairly uniform and fine-grained nature suggests deposition of sediments by the wind is one possibility.
PSP_004988_1085	This observation shows partial views of two high latitude pits. These polar pits contain gullies, small-scale slope features that are proposed to require some amount of liquid water to form. <br><br>Several of the gullies have multiple channels and debris aprons from numerous flows that occurred throughout time. Many of the gullies are seen to originate at a boulder layer at the pit edges. This layer is deteriorating and releasing boulders that can be seen rolling down the pit walls. The bright material near the pit edges is probably seasonal frost.<br><br>What is particularly interesting about these gullies is that some might be forming (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004988_1085_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, approximately 800 meters across, of the south-facing gullies in the bottom pit; 1590 x 1445; 7 MB). The gullies on this wall have incised alcoves, but only a few have well-developed channels.<br><br>This could be a region of current gully formation. Aiding this hypothesis is the fact that there are a couple of depressions between the visible gullies, suggestive of a developing gully where water and/or material removed from under the surface caused the overlying ground to collapse. It is also possible that water originating on the surface is carving out these depressions, although it is difficult to melt water ice at the temperatures found in this particular location.
PSP_004989_0945	Since Mars is colder than Earth, there is not just water ice at the poles, but also a concentration of carbon dioxide ice. Some of the carbon dioxide ice at the south pole is there all year long and called the residual cap. This image was taken near the south pole of Mars and shows a characteristic "Swiss cheese" pattern. <br><br>This pattern is created when there is relatively high, smooth material that is broken up into these circular-shaped depressions forming the "Swiss cheese" terrain. The depressions are thought to be caused by sublimation, which is when a material goes directly from a solid to a gas phase. Repeated images are taken of areas like this so the changes in depression size and where they form can be monitored through the seasons.
PSP_004996_1065	This observation shows layering in the south polar layered deposit exposed on a scarp. The south polar layered deposits are composed primarily of water ice with a small amount of dust. The layers formed over a large area near the south pole, probably over the past few million years. They are believed to record recent global climate changes on Mars in much the same way that polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide information about varying climatic conditions on Earth.<br><br>The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_004996_1065_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows a close up</a> of the layers (952 x 555; 2 MB). Some layers closer to the upper right corner of the subimage have an irregular wavy appearance. This may have been caused by the flow of ice at some point in the past. Some layers closer to the lower left corner of the subimage appear to be converging while others seem truncated. These are called unconformities. Unconformities form when a previous episode of erosion removes all or part of a layer and is later followed by more deposition.
PSP_005011_0885	This image of the south polar layered deposits shows far more detail than seen in previous images of this part of Mars. The most complete imaging coverage of the area south of 87 degrees south latitude was acquired by the Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter spacecraft in the 1970s.<br><br>These images showed a shallow scarp at this location, but it was not known whether the dozens of layers visible in this HiRISE image would be exposed. The MGS and Mars Odyssey orbiters could not view the regions near the poles. Such images of the Mars polar "terra incognita" will help scientists understand the geology of the south polar layered deposits, widely believed to record ancient Martian climate changes like ice ages on Earth.  For example, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005011_0885_cut_b.jpg'>this subimage shows</a> possible evidence that horizontal layers have been distorted by folding or flow (2048 x 4000; 8 MB).
PSP_005019_1970	The bottom of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, is marked by a steep scarp. It is likely that this scarp is the result of the deformation and collapse of the volcano under its own weight.<br><br>The scarp exposes the internal structure of the volcano, revealing a stack of once deeply buried lava layers. Atop the lava flows is a thick layer of relatively weak and homogeneous material, that might be volcanic ash or dust carried by dust storms.  The pit near the center of the image shows that the same basic layering extends for some distance up the flank of the volcano.<br><br>The pit must be more recent than the dust/ash layer since the pit cuts through that layer. While it is possible that the pit is very recent, this suggests that the mantling layer is quite old.  
PSP_005069_1670	This observation shows a portion of the north rim of Corprates Chasma, a large trough that forms the eastern part of the Valles Marineris, a system of canyons stretching for thousands of kilometers. <br><br>In this image, several faults are exposed along the surface of the rim. One fault can be seen particularly well centered <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005069_1670_cut_b.jpg'>on the right side of the subimage</a> (1062 x 874; 906 KB). <br><br>Multiple layers are also visible on the slopes descending from the edges of the flat topped rim. The layers may have formed from volcanic, lacustrine, and/or aeolian sediments once deposited in the Valles Marineris trough. Particularly prominent is a dark-toned layer near the top of the slope. This layer is composed of materials that are more resistant to erosion than the overlying brighter layers. In HiRISE images, this layer is resolved into a rubbly outcrop of meter-scale boulders.
PSP_005071_2150	This image shows a pair of pit craters on Alba Patera, a massive volcano on Mars. <br><br>The pit craters are the prominent deep features near the center of the image. Most of the other circular holes are impact craters. Pit craters form when material collapses into a subsurface void (commonly on volcanoes, such as Kilauea in Hawai'i). Voids may form on volcanoes when parts of the "plumbing" system transporting lava are drained, or when extension and stretching of the volcano causes gaps below the surface. <br><br>Pit craters may resemble impact craters. However, there is evidence that the two large depressions in this image are pit craters. Impact craters as large and deep as these would likely have a raised rim of material ejected during its formation.  Erosion of the rim would partially fill the crater, but these are relatively deep despite having no raised rim. Additionally, these pits are roughly aligned with other depressions outside the image, a likely arrangement for pit craters. <br><br>Layers exposed around the edges of these craters are likely old lava flows which covered the surface of the region, breaking up into boulders. The uppermost material has no boulders. This is likely a layer of dust (or possibly volcanic ash) which has draped the entire  area, obscuring much detail of the volcanic landscape. 
PSP_005082_1700	PSP_005082_1700 shows an assemblage of interesting terrain contacts located west of Ganges Chasma, a Martian canyon part of the equatorial Valles Marineris system.<br><br>The top portion of the image shows mottled plains that are covered in craters. It is possible that the plains are eroding and exposing (ìexhumingî) craters that formed long ago and were since buried. A crater that is being uncovered can look like a faint ring, of which many examples are visible here.  The edge of the plains is marked by a cliff located approximately halfway down the image. This cliff is the wall of a valley that might have once flowed into the enclosed trough, Ophir Cavus, located directly south of it.<br>  <br>Ophir Cavus is seen to have landslides on both of its walls. It contains dunes and what appears to be a coherent mass of material on its floor that is probably eroding. It also has a series of layers around its rim. These layers probably continue under the surrounding plains.<br><br>South of Ophir Cavus, located at the bottom of the image, are plains that have a much different appearance from the plains at the top. These plains have a few craters that might be exhumed, but also several fresher ones. The fresher craters have darker bottoms, implying that the depth to which these craters disturbed the surface corresponds with a darker layer. Some of the dark-bottomed craters have faint dark rays that have not been blown away by the wind; this also verifies that they are relatively recently formed.<br><br>The floor of the valley also has a large number of craters, many of which are small. The majority of these craters have a bright tail pointing in the southwest direction (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005082_1700_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 950 meters across; 1928 x 1346; 7 MB). This indicates that the wind was probably blowing from the northeast when these craters formed. Since wind directions change frequently on Mars, it is possible that a large number of the valleyís craters formed at the same time. This suggests that they are secondary craters: craters that form when material thrown out from a bigger impact is moving fast enough to create these craters. Secondary craters commonly form in clumps, also seen in the subimage.<br><br>Please note that the vertical stripes seen in the image are camera artifacts. They are not real features.
PSP_005095_0935	Like Earth, Mars has concentrations of water ice at both poles. Because Mars is so much colder however, carbon dioxide ice is deposited at high latitudes in the winter and is removed in the spring, analogous to winter-time water ice/snow on Earth. <br><br>Around the south pole there are areas of this carbon dioxide ice that do not disappear every spring, but rather survive winter after winter; this persistent carbon dioxide ice is called the south pole residual cap. The retention of carbon dioxide ice throughout the year by the southern polar cap is one characteristic that distinguishes it significantly from Mars' north polar cap.<br><br>As can be seen in this HiRISE image of the south pole residual cap, relatively high-standing smooth material is broken up by circular, oval, and blob-shaped depressions. This patterned terrain is called "swiss cheese" terrain. The high-standing areas are carbon dioxide ice with thicknesses of several to approximately 10 meters. The depressions are thought to be caused by the removal of this carbon dioxide ice by sublimation (the change of a material from solid directly to gas). As most depressions seem to have relatively flat floors, there is likely some layer below, possibly made of water ice, that cannot be as easily removed by sublimation. Complicated shapes arise when neighboring growing depressions intersect.<br><br>A previous Mars imaging system, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took images of the same places on the south pole residual cap every year for many years, and showed that there are annual changes taking place within it. By looking at different sizes and shapes of depressions in an image such as this, and by comparing images of the same place from year to year, the development of "swiss cheese" terrain can be described. The sublimation process may begin as a small, shallow depression in a smooth surface. This depression then deepens until reaching the resistant layer below, and continues to expand laterally in all directions, creating the generally round depressions we see today. Different heights and thicknesses of smooth areas, and different depths of depressions, may indicate that multiple episodes of accumulation and sublimation have occurred.<br><br>This is one of the locations previously monitored at lower resolution by MOC. With the high resolution and repeat-imaging capability of HiRISE, we intend to continue monitoring and better measure the amount of expansion of the depressions over one or more Mars years. This is one of the locations specifically targeted by HiRISE for this purpose.<br><br>Knowing the amount and rate of carbon dioxide removal can give us a better idea of the role of carbon dioxide (the main component of the Martian atmosphere) in polar and atmospheric processes, of current environmental and climatic conditions, and of how Mars climate may be changing.<br><br>In HiRISE images such as this one, it is evident on the slopes of the large, especially high mesa just above the center of the image that the carbon dioxide-rich material may be constructed of several individual horizontal layers. However, it also appears that as erosion eats into the mesa, pieces of a stronger mesa surface layer break off and are left strewn on the mesa slopes, where they may give the appearance of layering.<br><br>An interesting feature in this HiRISE image is the crisscrossing network of faint ridges and troughs on the upper smooth terrain. These may also be complexly involved in the sublimation and deposition of carbon dioxide ice.
PSP_005109_1770	This HiRISE observation shows an albedo change associated with an impact crater at the northeast edge of the image. (Albedo measures how much light is reflected by a surface. An albedo of 0 means that no light is reflected). A streak of light material extends away from the crater. This is a wind streak, so called since it results from the interaction of wind and topography. <br><br>Wind streaks are common in the area of this image as well as other areas on Mars. They form when dust is preferentially eroded or deposited downwind of a crater or other feature due to its effect on the wind. As such, they are useful indications of wind directions on the Martian surface, an important constraint on modeling the weather of the planet. <br><br>Some striations in the image are artifacts due to slight differences between the camera detectors.
PSP_005149_1715	Light-toned layering can be seen throughout this image taken along the plains south of Ius Chasma in Valles Marineris.<br><br>A portion of one of the troughs of Ius Chasma is visible in the lower right of the image. The layering is exposed where a meters-thick darker unit has been eroded away, suggesting the light-toned layered deposit is more extensive in area than what is visible by exposures along the plains.<br><br>The layering could have formed by several processes, including aeolian (wind-blown), fluvial (water-lain), and volcanism. If aeolian, then the material must be located elsewhere on Mars where it was eroded and then subsequently deposited by the wind here along the plains. A fluvial origin implies there was water activity that deposited the light-toned material, although there is no evidence for fluvial activity at this location. Explosive volcanism is a likely process that would have occurred in association with the emplacement of the darker lava flows that make up the plains.<br><br>The morphology of the light-toned layering is unlike that seen within Valles Marineris and indicates different processes operated along the plains compared to those that emplaced the deposits within the troughs.
PSP_005155_1030	A complex geologic history is on display in this image of the south polar layered deposits. These layered deposits are a mixture of dust and water-ice. Each layer is thought to record information about the state of the Martian climate at the time of its deposition.<br><br>The original stack of layered ice has eroded to produce a scarp that exposes the internal layers. Smooth material was then deposited to cover this scarp before being in turn eroded. Deposition on top of an eroded surface like this produces what geologists call an "unconformity in the stratigraphic record." Remnants of this smooth material can be seen  at the top of the image and draping the layered scarp near the image center.<br><br>Although it looks, at first glance, like this material has flowed down the scarp, that is unlikely to have happened. The extremely cold temperatures at the Martian poles mean that ice in general does not flow like we see it do here on Earth. There are also no indications of some of the geomorphologic features that flowing ice typically acquires (such as crevasses, compressional ridges or moraines). 
PSP_005160_1150	This observation shows the east-facing walls of an unnamed crater in Sisyphi Planum, near the south polar region. Gullies, as well as mantle terrain and polygons are visible; these features suggest that at some point in time, liquid and ice may have been present at and near the surface.<br><br>The gullies, which are rather eroded, have ample alcoves and subdued channels; dark patches and ripples in the bottom of the channels indicate that the most recent activity was aeolian (wind-driven) in nature. <br><br>Mantle terrains are characterized by their smooth surface and light, uniform color. They are widely interpreted as terrains blanketed by a mixture of ice and dust, deposited under climatic conditions different from that of today. The gullies in this image have alcove areas that seem to have cut through the mantle terrain, exposing the underlying materials. The <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005160_1150_cut_b.jpg'>subimage </a> (approximately 375 x 275 meters or 410 x 300 yards, 1500 x 1100 pixels, 4.8 MB) shows the boundary between one of the alcoves (to the bottom) and the surrounding mantled terrain (to the top). North is up, downhill is to the right, illumination is from the upper left. <br><br>Numerous fissures arranged forming polygons some 3 to 10 meters (3.3 to 11 yards) across are visible in the image. These are similar to features found in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica, where ice is present at or near the surface. Antarctica's polygons form by repeated expansion and contraction of the soil-ice mixture due to seasonal temperature oscillations; this results in polygonal networks of stress fractures.
PSP_005188_1765	The upper right corner of this observation shows a prominent ridge called a wrinkle ridge. The wrinkle ridge has been transected by the wall of the Ophir Chasma just south of the Martian equator. <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are linear to arcuate topographic highs typically consisting of a broad arch topped by a crenulated ridge. They have been identified on the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Venus. On Mars, they are many tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and may be several hundred meters high. They are characterized by asymmetrical cross sectional profiles and an offset in elevation on either side of the ridge. <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are most commonly believed to form from horizontal compression or shortening of the crust due to faulting and are often found in volcanic plains.
PSP_005194_1070	The scarp shown in this image marks the edge of the polar layered deposits. These layered deposits are a mixture of dust and water-ice. Each layer is thought to record information about the state of the Martian climate at the time of its deposition.<br><br>The polar layered deposits were once more extensive, but have been eroded back to their current size. Most of this erosion takes places at inclined scarps (such as this one) which retreat as icy material is ablated away.<br><br>Other processes are also operating on these deposits as exemplified by the fault that is visible on the left of the image. Layers appear offset from one side of the fault to another indicating that the layered deposits have been fractured into large blocks that have moved relative to each other. The source of the stress that  caused this fracturing is unknown; some possible examples are subsidence of the underlying terrain or perhaps melting of a portion of the base of the ice-sheet.<br><br>This particular region of the layered deposits (Ultimi Lingula) contains many examples of this brittle fracture (which is otherwise rare in these deposits). Another less obvious fault lies near the center of the image at the base of the scarp. This fault does not break through, or even deform, the upper layers which may indicate that the fault occurred when only half the layered deposits had accumulated. These observations point to a history of faulting in this region that at least spans the age range of these layered deposits.
PSP_005313_1040	This image shows layering at the base of the south polar layered deposits exposed on a scarp. The south polar layered deposits are composed primarily of water ice with a small amount of dust. <br><br>The layers were laid down over a large area near the south pole, probably over the past few million years. They are believed to record recent global climate changes on Mars in much the same way that polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide information about varying climatic conditions on Earth.<br><br>Some of the layers have an irregular or wavy appearance. This may have been caused by the flow or deformation of the ice at some point in the past, in addition to uneven erosion. A few layers also appear to be converging or to be truncated (center of image). These are called unconformities. Unconformities form when an episode of erosion removes all or parts of existing layers and is later followed by more deposition. Surface fractures, channels, knobs and other features, along with the obscuration of layer contacts, point to a comicated recent history, but also make it difficult to characterize indiviual layers.
PSP_005334_2170	This observation shows pits in Acheron Catena, a chain of circular depressions located southeast of Alba Patera, the widest and flattest volcano on Mars. The layers seen around the pit rims (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005334_2170_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 350 meters across) are likely lava flows from Alba Patera or the nearby Tharsis Mons.<br><br>The pits probably formed by collapse into empty space beneath the surface as opposed to being formed by an impactor from space. Some of the pits have large piles of material in their centers. These piles are evidence of collapse of the walls, which may have occurred after the main collapse event that formed each pit. The second pit from the right has an indistinct north rim; it appears that there were at least two collapse events here.<br><br>A couple of the pits have oval shaped craters on their walls (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005334_2170_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a>). The craters were almost certainly circular when they formed, but time and gravity have allowed the deformation of their shape by <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'>mass wasting.</a>
PSP_005336_1620	This observation shows a small rayed crater formed by impact of a meteoroid, likely a small asteroid, on the surface (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005336_1620_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>; 2196 x 1442; 3 MB). (An impacting comet could produce the same feature, but asteroid impacts are expected to be more common on Mars). This crater has rayed ejecta preserved around it, forming linear streaks and striations away from the crater. Rays provide some information about the impact event, particularly the direction of the impactor. <br><br>In this case, the impacting asteroid approached from the northeast. The rays are relatively short and sparse in the uprange direction (the direction from which the impactor came) and long downrange. In addition to relatively fine material, boulders were ejected from the crater; the largest of these are also found on the downrange side.
PSP_005342_1225	This image reveals depressions in the mid-latitude mantle within a crater at Peneus Patera. <br><br>The depressions, several of which have coalesced together, have scalloped edges. Such features form what is often referred to as "scalloped terrain." Scalloped terrain is most commonly found at approximately 55 degrees north and south latitude and has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice by sublimation (evaporation). The formation of scalloped terrain is believed to be an ongoing process today.<br><br>In this image, steeper scarps consistently face the south pole while more gentle slopes face in the direction of the equator. This is most likely due to differences in solar heating. <br><br>On the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with scalloped terrain, and indicates that the surface has undergone stress potentially caused by subsidence, desiccation, or thermal contraction. Also on the surface surrounding the depressions are dark toned dust devil tracks.
PSP_005343_2170	This observation shows an equatorial scarp (cliff) with possible landslides and boulder tracks.  <br><br>The cliff has several distinct layers visible near its top. There is a smoother, possibly fine-grained layer on top, underlain by a relatively bright and a dark layer. It is possible that the entire cliff face consists of layers but that erosion has not exposed others yet. <br><br>There are two main landslide scars, locations where a landslide has carved into the slope. Both of the scars have boulder tracks, several of which have boulders at their ends as they progress down the slope or reach the end of the slope. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005343_2170_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage</a> (approximately 480 meters across) shows boulder tracks from the landslide scar on the left side of the image. Some boulders can be seen forming trails along the slope at the top part of the subimage, while others can be seen at the end of their trails. For example, see the two boulders just right of center at the bottom of the subimage.
PSP_005346_1755	This image shows plains northwest of Juventae Chasma, one of the Martian canyons that are part of the equatorial Valles Marineris system. The two most noticeable features in this scene are craters on mesas (plateaus) and raised, winding ridges.<br><br>The raised ridges are inverted channels. It is likely that liquid water, either pure or salt water, flowed through these channels. The channels are raised because streams transport sediment as they flow, deposit the heavier sediment on the stream floor, and, eventually fill in once their water supply dwindles.  Over time, wind erosion modifies a landscape, and this has played an important role on these plains. It eroded the land around the channels leaving the remnant channels exposed and standing high. The channels did not erode as much since they were more resistant, possibly because the deposited sediment had cemented together.<br><br>The craters on mesas are also evidence of active wind erosion. When craters form, they eject material out onto the surrounding landscape. It appears that several of the cratersí ejecta visible here cemented, making the ejecta more resistant to erosion and leaving them standing high as craters on plateaus.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005346_1755_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage</a> (approximately 1120 meters across) shows a juncture of two of the inverted channels. It is likely that the water flowed from the left to the right of the scene, because channels usually join rather than divert unless there is an obvious obstacle in the way. No such obstacle is seen here, but one might have been present when the stream originally flowed. However, there is no way of knowing this.
PSP_005349_0930	This 4 kilometer diameter feature near the edge of the south polar residual cap was recognized in Mariner 9 and Viking Orbiter images taken in the 1970s, but its origin could not be inferred. It was therefore targeted for HiRISE stereo imaging.  <br><br>The bright areas in this image are covered by carbon dioxide frost, and the "swiss cheese" terrain typical of the south polar residual cap covers much of the imaged area. The dark walls of the circular depression do not have as much frost on them, and are fractured in a polygonal pattern. Apparently the surface of the walls has been extensively modified by thermal expansion and contraction of water ice.  <br><br>It also appears that the "swiss cheese" terrain of the residual cap has buried the floor of the circular depression, as well as the terrain surrounding the feature, making it difficult to infer the origin of this depression. Its circular symmetry is consistent with an impact origin, but there is no evidence of a crater rim or ejecta (perhaps because they have been buried). The depression may have formed by collapse, but there is little evidence of extensional fractures that would be expected around a collapse pit.  Analysis of HiRISE stereo data may help the interpretation of this feature.
PSP_005355_2125	How could a valley with flowing water become a high-standing ridge?<br><br>When rivers flow, they carry sediment or particles with them. The heavier and larger particles are deposited on the bottom as characteristics of the flow, such as a decrease in speed. The sediments build up and, over time, can fill in a river completely. This would typically occur on a flat plain, so that the filled-in river would be level with the surrounding banks. <br><br>As more time passes, wind erosion affects the landscape. The sediment in the valley could be more resistant to erosion, which would allow it to exist while its banks erode.<br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005300_005399/PSP_005355_2125/PSP_005355_2125_RED.abrowse.jpg'>The sinuous ridge in this image,</a> in eastern Arabia Terra in the northern hemisphere, might have been a valley with flowing water in ancient times. At the north (top) end of the image, the ridge transitions to a depression as opposed to being raised. This depression (not imaged by HiRISE) extends into a valley. The Martian valley networks are thought to have formed by flowing water billions of years ago. At the center of the right side of the image (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005355_2125_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, approximately 350 meters across) there is a branch in the ridge, which supports the valley network theory.<br><br>(A sinuous feature is one that winds about in a snake-like pattern, and a ridge is a high-standing feature.)
PSP_005361_2005	This image shows streamlined features in the northwest Tharsis region. The trough running diagonally to the left near the bottom of the image is part of the Jovis Fossae, a series of parallel troughs.<br><br>Streamlined features are carved by catastrophic floods. When a flood encounters an object, it diverts around it and erodes material in its path. One great example of a streamlined island is at the top left of the image between the branch of the channels. The flow was likely from the right to the left, as suggested by the fact that the island tapers off to the left. Part of the island stands higher than the rest. This section was probably higher than the floodwaters reached.<br><br>There is another streamlined island about one third of the way down the image. This island is very narrow, and its shape is also consistent with the flood coming from the right.<br><br>This island has a couple of dark slope streaks, as does an elongated mesa near the Jovis fossa (trough) at the bottom of the image. It is thought that small impacts and rockfalls can initiate the dust avalanches that are currently believed to form the slope streaks. The dark material for the slope streaks probably came from the dark layers visible at the top of the mesa; <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005361_2005_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 300 meters (328 yards) across.
PSP_005369_1925	This image shows the portions of the interior slopes and central uplift of an approximately 25 kilometer (approx. 16 mile) diameter impact crater in the Terra Sabaea region of Mars.<br><br>Along the slopes of the crater walls and flowing down the central uplift are hundreds of dark slope streaks, features that are up to a few hundred meters wide and several kilometers long. They generally start at a point and widen downslope as a single streak or branch into two or more streaks.<br><br>Many hypotheses have been proposed for how they formed on the surface, such as  liquid stains or flows, dry avalanching, geochemical weathering, and moisture wicking. Recent observations of dark slope streaks at 78 unique sites in HiRISE images have shown that they have topographic relief where the dark interior surface is lower than the surroundings. The relief is most apparent in images that have low sun illumination (i.e., sun low in the sky), where the dust is sufficiently thick, and along slopes facing away from the sun.<br><br>These results by Chuang et al. (2007), soon to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, indicates that material must have been removed in the formation of streaks. Their conclusion is that slope streaks are most likely formed by avalanches of dry dust, similar to previous conclusions by other authors on this subject.
PSP_005370_1845	This observation shows plains speckled with craters in north Sinus Meridiani, a dark albedo feature.<br><br>Several of the craters have wind streaks off their southwest rims. This indicates that recently, the wind has been dominantly coming from the northeast in this region. As the wind blows, it erodes material off the crater rims, and this material can be deposited downwind, as seen here in the form of streaks. Eventually the craters' rims will be completely eroded and just faint circular features will remain.<br><br>There is a bright mesa at the top of the image that also has a very prominent wind streak. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005370_1845_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage</a> (approximately 1 kilometer across) shows the bright mesa located at the top right of the image. Part of the wind streak is visible in the lower left. <br><br>This streak can also be seen in color (see PSP_005370_1845_RGB), where the streak appears redder than its surroundings.  Differences in color result from differences in composition and/or particle sizes. The western edge of the mesa appears in this color product to be tinted red, similar in tone to the mesa's wind streak.  
PSP_005372_1515	Central peaks form when a large impact crater rebounds after the initial compression stage, lifting deep bedrock up into hills or mountains. Ritchey Crater is a large (more than 100 kilometer diameter), well-preserved impact crater in the southern highlands of Mars, south of Valles Marineris.<br><br>This HiRISE color image reveals a rich diversity of colors and textures in the central region of the crater. For example, the <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005372_1515_cut_b.jpg'>subimage shows</a> several densely fractured outcrops of bedrock with a range of colors due to different rock types, partially covered by dark sand dunes.<br><br>In the middle of the area is medium-dark material that contains many bright rock fragmentsóperhaps breccia (broken up and randomly jumbled rocks). There are raised ridgesóboth straight and sinuousówhich may mark fractures and channels that could have been indurated (hardened) by water-deposited minerals. The heat of the impact event could have driven hydrothermal circulation of water for many centuries.  <br><br>The colors in this image are from the infrared, red, and blue-green filters, in which each color band is given a separate contrast stretch. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005372_1515_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage</a> the colors were further enhanced in intensity to reveal more subtle variations. If a rover could land here, it would  be able to study a treasure trove of diverse rocks and minerals and ancient environments.
PSP_005375_1675	This image shows a crater with a wind streak in the southwest Tharsis region.<br><br>The crater is a relatively pristine one that has not experienced extensive modification as seen by the existence of its steep slopes and raised rims. However, it has gone through some changes, such as the small crater on its south rim and the dunes on its floor.<br><br>The wind streak to the left of the crater indicates that the wind was coming from the northeast/east direction(the right of the image) when this crater formed.  The wind caused the craterís ejecta to be deposited in the downwind direction. The crater in the middle of the wind streak (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005375_1675_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 350 meters across), existed before the crater with the wind streak formed. There is a thin veneer of the larger craterís ejecta on top of the smaller crater; also, there are ejecta blocks from the large craterís impact visible on top of the smaller crater.<br><br>It is unknown what makes the wind streak two-toned with a darker halo surrounding the brighter interior. It is possible that the particles in the wind streak have different average sizes and that light scattering makes one set of particles appear brighter.
PSP_005376_1575	The linear depressions that cross this HiRISE image are geological features called "graben." In this part of Mars, graben such as these are collectively named Memnonia Fossae. <br><br>Graben can form when the ground is stretched apart due to tectonic forces and can also form when magma is injected underground along long vertical fractures called dikes. The magma forces the dikes open, causing the extension of the ground surface. Both tectonic and dike-related graben are found in Iceland, where tectonic forces both stretch apart the island and enable magmatic dikes to form. <br><br>By studying the topography of graben, scientists are able to discern between tectonic and magmatic origins. This part of Mars is especially well suited for this kind of analysis because the ground surface prior to graben formation was relatively flat, making graben-related topography easier to identify and study. Topographic analyses of graben in Memnonia Fossae has revealed that these features formed over magmatic dikes. This means that the Memnonia Fossae are indicators of underground magmatic activity, rather than regional tectonic extension. These kinds of details are key to interpreting the geologic evolution of the surface of Mars.
PSP_005381_0870	This image shows a scarp exposing the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). The polar layered deposits are thought to record recent climate variations on Mars, similar to ice ages on Earth.<br><br>Radar data indicate that the SPLD are ice-rich, with variations in dust contamination likely causing the layering visible here. HiRISE images of the SPLD will help to unravel Mars' climate history, but this image illustrates how this effort is complicated.<br><br>The development of surface features, by erosion, deposition, or modification of the surface, makes it difficult to determine the characteristics of the layers themselves. Some of the layers appear wavy, perhaps due to folding, flow, or uneven erosion since they were laid down. Short, branching, often radial channel systems are cut into the surface of the layers in places. These may be related to "spiders," thought to be formed as carbon dioxide gas flows along the surface when the seasonal polar cap sublimates in the spring. Pits and polygonal fractures are visible on the layers as well.<br><br>Apparently this exposure of SPLD is relatively old, as these features probably take many years to form. While these features are interesting in their own right, they disturb the SPLD outcrops and make it more difficult to measure the thickness of layers and compare them to other outcrops of SPLD.
PSP_005383_1255	Dust devils make dark, diffuse scribble markings on the surface by kicking up dust, and are especially active in the summertime over dark surfaces, such as those with many deposits of sand-sized material.<br><br>The surface warms up in the sunlight, creating the right conditions to form dust devils. Mars also has larger dust storms that can deposit a thin layer of dust and eliminate the dust devil tracks.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005383_1255_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage</a> are portions of two HiRISE images, one <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004249_1255'>acquired on 23 June 2007</a> before the great dust storms of that year, and this one acquired on 19 September 2007. The pattern of dust devil tracks has completely changed over just three months! (The subimage is 1770 x 1283; 2 MB). <br><br>The tracks <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004249_1255'>visible in the 23 June image</a> formed in southern spring or summer of this year (2007; we have a series of images over this location), were erased by deposition from the large dust storms,and then new dust devils created the dark markings seen in the 19 September. These images show a small portion of the sand dunes in Russell Crater, which are of special interest due to the peculiar channels that formed on the steep slopes. 
PSP_005385_1640	This image shows an outcrop of light-toned rock in Eos Chaos, a knobby region which transitions into the Eos Chasma. The outcrop is exposed in the wall of a mesa (a flat-topped, steep-sided plateau). <br><br>The outcrop is prominent in the eastern part of the image. Most of the material is light and shows many small scarps or benches. In places these appear to indicate boundaries between layers, but they are often discontinuous. The light material is buried by a thin mantle of dark material in places; the dark material is from other rock layers&mdash;possibly those above the outcrop&mdashand has fallen or been blown over the light rock. <br><br>Near the top of the outcrop, there is a distinctive layer that appears as a dark band at low resolution. At the full resolution of HiRISE, this appears to be a layer breaking up into angular boulders, indicating different rock properties than the underlying light rock. There does appear to be some light material above this layer, suggesting that the process that deposited the light material continued for some time.<br><br>Ultimately, the mesa is capped by a thin veneer of dark material with a rippled texture, forming most of the southern part of the image. These ripples likely formed by wind blowing sand or dust, but they may have become indurated (hardened) enough to become inactive, since they are not found within small craters on the mesa top. <br><br>The light deposits could have formed by a variety of processes. Proposed deposition mechanisms for light-toned sediments on Mars include those from rivers or lakes, volcanic ash or wind-blown sand or dust. The dark boulder-rich band is also of uncertain origin, but it is likely harder rock, more resistant to erosion.
PSP_005387_1935	Troughs on the northeast flanks of Ascraeus Mons, one of the volcanoes on the Tharsis Rise, are the main points of interest in this observation.  <br><br>The troughs are non-linear and intersecting, and appear to be of different depths. With several exposed layered sequences of lava flows (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005387_1935_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 350 meters across), the troughs possibly mark the paths of these ancient flows that created tunnels under the surface, and that have since collapsed into voids.<br><br>The bottoms of the troughs are littered with circular depressions. While some of these are probably impact craters, most are likely collapse features. When a large number of small craters are in one location, they are often secondary craters that were formed by ejecta (material ejected from the surface) from another, larger impact. Such craters would be in clumps and often overlap. This type of distribution is not seen here; the depressions are concentrated on the trough floors, evidence of collapse.<br>
PSP_005388_1975	Pangboche Crater is a very fresh, 11 kilometer (6.8 mile) diameter crater near the summit of Olympus Mons, a large shield volcano that extends 500 km (310 miles) in diameter. Geologically young craters are important to investigate the current cratering rate on Mars. There are multiple lines of evidence that indicate that Pangboche is geologically young.  <br><br>Pangboche has a very distinct, sharp rim. Over time, crater rims degrade and blend into their surroundings. It has steep walls as indicated by the numerous boulders rolling down the walls. For boulders and material to dislodge from a slope because of gravity alone, slopes need to be rather steep (approximately 30 degrees). <br><br>The interior of the crater contains material that likely slumped off the walls during late stages of its formation. The north wall of the crater has material that has not slumped to the floor, instead forming a terrace. <br><br>Also noteworthy is the abundance of small craters that surround, but do not occur within, Pangboche. These are mostly secondary craters that formed when ejecta from an impact hit the surface. If the small craters were primary craters (formed from an impactor from space), then they would be expected to be within Pangboche as well. Secondaries commonly occur in clumps as seen here (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005388_1975_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage,</a> approximately 2 km across).  The strong clustering indicates that these craters are secondaries.<br>
PSP_005392_0995	This image covers a portion of the ice-rich south polar layered deposits. Layers in the Mars polar regions are of great interest because layers in ice on the Earth, as in the Antarctic and Greenland ice caps, are known to contain records of past atmospheric, environmental, and climate conditions. By studying Mars polar layers, we hope to be able to understand the past climate and history of water on the red planet.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005392_0995_cut_b.jpg'>Of particular interest is the small,</a> approximately 330 meter (360 yard) diameter impact crater. The number of impact craters on a planetary surface is often used to estimate the age of that surface (because the older a surface is, the more time that surface has had to accumulate craters, and thus the more craters that surface will have on it, assuming a constant cratering rate). The polar layered deposits on Mars are believed to be very young because there are no large craters on them and very few small craters. The high resolution of HiRISE will enable these craters to be studied in detail, perhaps allowing the number of craters&mdash;and thus the surface age&mdash;to be better constrained.<br><br>A problem with using craters to determine age on the icy polar layered deposits is that erosion of the icy substrate and relaxation of crater topography (i. e., relief becoming more gentle) is probably more rapid on ice than on harder rocky surfaces. A detailed study of craters in ice will help better to understand this process of how craters in ice degrade, or deteriorate, with time. Perhaps then we will  know how to use the number and distribution of craters over the icy polar layered deposits in constraining the geologic and climate history of the Mars polar regions.
PSP_005401_1960	These channels emerge from a fracture system called the Gordii Fossae to the east of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system.<br><br>The channels bear superficial resemblance to features formed by floods of water. It is most likely that the channels were first carved by water and then coated with lava.  However, it is possible that they are purely volcanic in origin. This puzzle will be solved by investigating a number of similar channels across Mars.  <br><br>The hills are part of the Sulci Gordii, a series of knobs that form an apron around the eastern part of Olympus Mons. It is likely that these hills resulted from a giant landslide as part of the volcano collapsed under its own weight. The lumpy landslide deposit is now partially buried under younger lava flows, many of which seem to have been erupted from fractures around Olympus Mons.  
PSP_005409_1530	The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005400_005499/PSP_005409_1530/PSP_005409_1530_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>full observation</strong></a> shows an unnamed central pit crater in the southern mid-latitudes. Impact craters have different morphologies depending on the size of the impactor and the properties of the target material.<br><br>Smaller impactors generate bowl-shaped craters, while very large impactors create craters with central peaks or central rings. It is currently unknown what causes central pits to form.<br><br>The central pit crater is not very fresh, as evidenced by a number of craters occurring within it. Recently, HiRISE had identified ponded and pitted material in several fresh craters around Mars that is undetectable in lower resolution images. The pits are thought to form from escaping volatiles (gases) that were caused by boiling ices present at the time of impact.<br><br>Although the central pit, located near the bottom of the image, has degraded over time, there are still some remnant pits that appear to have coalesced (joined, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005409_1530_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>, approximately 1.5 kilometers across). It is possible that all central pit craters on Mars consist of coalesced, smaller pits.<br><br><strong>Note: </strong> This caption refers to the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005400_005499/PSP_005409_1530/PSP_005409_1530_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>full observation</strong></a>; the image above is actually a fresher, simple crater on top of the larger, older central pit crater.<br>
PSP_005410_1115	This image shows polar pit gullies in a depression. The gullies do not appear to have been active recently, as their channels and alcoves are covered with polygonal fractures and ripples that have formed over time. The alcoves contain boulders from eroding layers up-slope. Several of the alcoves extend to the slope rim, suggesting head-ward erosion.<br><br>The rest of the scene contains abundant polygonal ground, thought to have formed by processes involving ground ice. This image is at a high latitude where polygonal terrain is common. This feature is not found in equatorial regions, which supports a relationship with ground ice because ground ice is not stable near the equator today.<br><br>There are several muted circles on the plains in the lower half of the image; these are possibly relaxed craters. If a crater forms in ice-rich ground, the ice enhances the degradation of the crater and gives the crater a ìsoftenedî appearance. 
PSP_005411_1535	Alluvial fans are deposits of sand, gravel, and sometimes boulders that were eroded from steep slopes (mountain fronts or basin walls) and deposited on plains at the base of the slope. Erosion of deep alcoves into the walls of Holden Crater (155 kilometers in diameter) provided sediment to these alluvial fans, that have coalesced into a large deposit called a bajada.<br><br>Most Martian impact craters that contain large alluvial fans are clustered between 18 and 29 degrees South, and the Holden bajada is the largest of these deposits recognized to date. Inverted channels are located on the alluvial fans, where the old stream beds were more resistant to later wind erosion than the fine-grained sediment deposited outside the channels; preferential erosion left the channel beds exposed as ridges. Many ripples of more recent, wind-blown sand are found between the older inverted channels.<br><br>The<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) would land on the bajada and drive across the traversable ripples to the south, where the inverted channels, layers, and evidence for past fluvial activity are located. 
PSP_005414_1735	The chain of pits visible in this image formed by collapse as the giant shield volcano, Arsia Mons, was pulled apart. While magma intruding into the volcano might have pushed the rocks aside, it is also possible that the collapse is caused by the volcano falling apart underneath its own weight.  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005414_1735_cut_b.jpg'>The small pit in the middle of the chain</a> was discovered by a team of scientists from the <a href='http://www.usgs.gov/'>U.S. Geological Survey</a> and <a href='http://www.asu.edu'>Arizona State University</a> using data from the <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'>THEMIS camera</a> onboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft <a href='http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/odyssey/odyssey-20070921.html'>during a search for possible cave entrances</a>. They informally named this pit "Annie." (The subimage is 1500 x 1500; 2 MB).<br><br>A section of the HiRISE image over "Annie" has been specially processed to enhance the contrast in the shadowed areas. This shows that the pit is is largely filled with wind blown materials. Shadow measurements indicate that the floor is about 112 meters (367 feet) below the rim. This is an example of how the different NASA missions are working together to shed light on the darkest mysteries on Mars.
PSP_005418_1075	This enhanced color image (1.2 kilometers or 0.7 miles across) shows a section of the south polar layered deposits, which are an accumulation of layers consisting mostly of water ice and dust. Perhaps their closest analog on Earth would be the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica.<br><br>This image is particularly interesting because the layers are not flat-lying but rather appear wavy. This appearance could partly be an ìillusionî due to erosion after the flat-lying layers were deposited. In that case, the wavy appearance is due to the fact that the layer edges are wavy, going into and out of the plane of the outcrop exposing the layers (here, <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005418_1075_cut_b.jpg'>into and out of the computer screen</a>).<br><br>Alternatively, this waviness could be due to deformation of the layers folding caused by flow of the ice. Here, the flow probably occurred long ago since current temperatures are too low to allow the ice to flow at a significant rate.
PSP_005419_1380	This image, part of the south-facing slopes of a massif in Promethei Terra in the southern highlands, shows flow-like features (tongue-shaped lobes, parallel ridges) that indicate movement of surface materials downhill and towards the southwest, following the regional slope. (See this <a href='http://themis-data.asu.edu/img/~I08036007.html'> THEMIS image </a> for regional context.)<br><br>The difference in elevation between the ridge (near the top or northern-most portion of the image) and the valley (to the south) is over 2,200 meters (7,200 feet); illumination is from the lower-left. <br><br>These flow-like features are reminiscent of those observed in terrestrial <a href='http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2004/3072/fs-2004-3072.html'> landslides </a> and <a href='http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/index.html'> rock glaciers </a>, in which the downhill movement of rocks and soils is facilitated by an agent (most commonly water in landslides, ice in glaciers) that acts as a lubricant and provides cohesion. Theoretical calculations predict that under current and recent Martian climate conditions, neither water nor ice would be stable near the surface for extended periods of time in this region. The temperatures are so low that water would freeze, and then quickly sublime, because the air is very thin and dry. Ice could, though, be stable at present approximately 1 meter (3 feet) or more below the surface.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005419_1380_cut_b.jpg'>The subimage</a> (approximately 390 x 260 meters or 420 x 280 yards; 1541 x 1022 pixels, 1.6 MB) shows in detail some of the ridges developed in the slope deposits. Numerous fissures cut through the surface, forming polygons 5 to 10 meters (5.5 to 11 yards) across. Such well-preserved polygons indicate that the downhill flow had stopped before they formed. Polygonal features similar to these are common in terrestrial periglacial regions such as Antarctica, where ice is present at or near the surface. Antarctica's polygons formed by repeated expansion and contraction of the soil-ice mixture due to seasonal temperature oscillations. 
PSP_005421_1215	The terrain in this image is located in Amphitrites Patera, in the southern hemisphere of Mars. <br><br>A smooth mantle, apparently made of mostly fine material, covers an older underlying surface. For example, in the center of the image we can distinguish the shape of an ancient crater (roughly 3 kilometers or 1.9 miles across) that was filled by the mantling material. Subsequent erosion of this material has partly exhumed the crater. At full HiRISE resolution the smooth surface is revealed to contain criss-crossing cracks and a few scattered blocks.<br><br>The various large depressions we observe within this mantle have scalloped edges, typically with a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentle equator-facing slope. This oriented asymmetry is believed to be caused by insolation, although the precise formation process remains unknown. These scalloped depressions are typically found in zones of the mid-latitude mantle of Mars. They are generally located between 45 and 60 degrees in both hemispheres. <br><br>It is clear that these features have grown, as some of the depressions have apparently coalesced together, and their formation could involve sublimation (the process of solid material going directly to a gaseous state) of interstitial ice. 
PSP_005424_1075	This image shows high latitude terrain near the Sisyphi Montes. Patterned ground is everywhere throughout the scene, and there are several muted craters that have relaxed over time due to the presence of ground ice.<br><br>Dark splotches are also common. Using full HiRISE resolution, the dark splotches exist around boulders. It is possible that the boulders are ejecta from the freshest crater in the scene, the small crater near the top of the image.  They could also be from another impact crater not in this image or be a result of a periglacial stone sorting process that leaves the large boulders isolated.<br>
PSP_005424_1700	This observation shows a portion of Aurorae Chaos, chaotic terrain east of the Vallis Marineris canyon system. Aurorae Chaos extends from Capri and Eos Chasmata on the west into Hydraotes and Aureum Chaos on the north and east.  <br><br>Chaotic terrain is thought to form from subsurface collapse following volatile release. It is possible that the Martian crust was at one time enriched in ices that became gases or liquid at relatively low temperatures upon encountering a heat source or was violently shaken. These ices existed in spaces between soil particles. If a large volume of volatiles is suddenly released, then there is a large portion of the soil volume missing.  The soil cannot support itself, so it collapses.<br><br>Since chaotic terrain is often located at the head of the Martian outflow channels (giant flood plains), it is also possible that the chaotic regions are the source of the fluids that formed the outflow channels. Aurorae Chaos connects to outflow channels via other chaotic regions.
PSP_005442_1660	This HiRISE image shows a graben (roughly 2.5 kilometers or 1.6 miles wide) cutting a ridge near Memnonia Sulci, a region of Mars west of the massive Tharsis volcanic province.<br><br>A graben is a trough created when two normal faults (faults dipping at an angle, with the overhanging wall sliding downwards) opposite each other lower the block of rock in between them. They are commonly associated with the tectonically-driven extension of a region and are also found in volcanic areas. Graben occur on many planets and moons, including Earth. <br><br>In this case, the graben (running roughly east-west, indicating extension in the north-south direction) is cutting a ridge, showing that the graben is more recent. The ridge may also be tectonic in origin, representing a different epoch and different type of tectonic activity.<br><br>Relationships like this can be used to determine the sequence of events in the history of the region. The graben walls can also expose the local rocks at depth; in this case there is no obvious indication of layering.  
PSP_005449_1835	This image shows outcrops of several units of rock in the Meridiani region of Mars, near the landing site of the Opportunity rover. <br><br>Across the image, the tone and texture of the surface changes in a variety of ways. In some areas the surface is knobby, in others pitted or rough; the brightness of the surface also changes, often in conjunction with changes to the texture. This is because different rock layers are being exposed across the scene. Although the area is quite flat on a large scale, slightly different amounts of erosion expose different layers of rock. <br><br>These different rock units probably correspond to deposition of sediments under varied conditions, possibly by entirely different processes. Alternatively, the rocks could have all been deposited in the same way, but with different source materials, grain sizes, or cementation of the rock. At the Opportunity landing site, much of the rock appears to be aeolian (wind-deposited) sandstone, but that may represent only a part of a more diverse, thicker accumulation of sediments.<br><br>Images like this help to understand the broader picture of sedimentary layering on Mars. 
PSP_005452_1700	This image shows numerous valleys and channels along rock in southwestern Melas Chasma. The valleys extend down (south) and merge with other valleys until they reach layered sediment in a basin located to the southeast of this image.<br><br>The interpretation is that the valleys formed by precipitation in the late Hesperian and the water that formed them collected in the basin to produce a lake where sediment was deposited. This location is therefore particularly interesting to scientists because it shows water activity that resulted from rain in a relatively young region near the equator of Mars.<br><br>The lighter unit at the top of the image is composed of sulfates as determined by the <strong><a href='http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMUC75V9ED_0.html'>OMEGA instrument</a></strong> on Mars Express, providing further evidence for water activity at this location. The dark streaks that crisscross near the bottom of the image are dust devil tracks that indicate both active winds as well as dust cover that have modified the surfaces in the more recent history.
PSP_005456_1650	This image shows the feature dubbed &ldquo;Home Plate&rdquo; in Gusev Crater, the site of the <a href='http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/index.html'>Mars Exploration Rover</a> Spirit's investigation of the surface.  <br><br>Spirit is visible inside the perimeter of the bright &ldquo;Home Plate&rdquo; feature, near the 5:30 position. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005456_1650_cut_b.jpg'>This color image</a> was created using only the blue-green and red HiRISE channels, so the &ldquo;B&rdquo; in this RGB product was synthesized using data from the two available channels. 
PSP_005514_1360	This image shows part of the floor of Rabe Crater, a large (108 kilometers, or 67 miles in diameter) impact crater in the Southern Highlands.<br><br>Dark dunes&mdash;accumulations of wind blown sand&mdash;cover part of crater's floor, and contrast with the surrounding bright-colored outcrops. The extreme close-up view reveals a thumbprint-like texture of smaller ridges and troughs covering the surfaces of the larger dunes. These smaller ripples are also formed and shaped by blowing wind in the thin atmosphere of Mars.<br><br>One puzzling question is why the dunes are dark compared with the relative bright layered material contained within the crater. The probable answer is that the source of the dark sand is not local to this crater; rather, this topographic depression has acted as a sand trap that has collected material being transported by winds blowing across the plains outside the crater.
PSP_005514_1925	<a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005500_005599/PSP_005514_1925/PSP_005514_1925_RED.abrowse.jpg'>Centered in this image</a> is a high-standing mound of material that sits within a large impact crater (the edges of which are not visible). Evident are numerous dark streaks that originate in the higher elevation areas near the center of the mound.<br><br>These streaks are possibly areas where the lighter surface dust cover has been disturbed and partially stripped away, revealing a darker layer beneath the dust. The dark streaks fade fairly rapidly as layers of bright dust settle over them.
PSP_005543_1725	The parial circular or ringed structure <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005500_005599/PSP_005543_1725/PSP_005543_1725_RED.abrowse.jpg'>in the middle of this scene</a> is an impact crater, approximately 3.25 kilometers (approx. 2 miles) in diameter. <br><br>Since its formation, the crater has had its southern half cut away by the formation of the gorge, called Ganges Chasma. The resulting exposure of rocks along the rim of the cliff allows planetary geologists to study a cut-away, side-view of layered rocks. This view is particularly interesting here because the rock layers of the upper plains are visible in their original form outside of the crater, and in modified form within/beneath the crater, along with structures imparted by the impact.<br><br>The floor of the crater may have been filled by lavas or other material that is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding layers, since the floor of the crater sticks out into the chasma.

PSP_005558_9040	The HiRISE instrument would make a great backyard telescope for viewing Mars, and we can also use it at Mars to view other planets, <strong><a href='jupiter.php'>such as Jupiter</a></strong>.<br><br>This is an image of Earth and the Moon, acquired at 5:20 a.m. MST on 3 October 2007, at a range of 142 million kilometers, which gives the HiRISE image a scale of 142 km/pixel and an Earth diameter of about 90 pixels and a Moon diameter of 24 pixels. The phase angle is 98 degrees, which means that less than half of the disks of the Earth and Moon have direct illumination. We could image Earth/Moon at full disk illumination only when they are on the opposite side of the sun from Mars, but then the range would be much greater and the image would show less detail.  <br><br>On the day this image was taken, the Japanese Kayuga (Selene) spacecraft was en route from the Earth to the Moon, and has since <a href='http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/selene/index_e.html'>returned spectacular images and movies.</a>  <br><br>On the Earth image we can make out the west coast outline of South America at lower right, although the clouds are the dominant features.

PSP_005571_0950	This scene is about 2.7 kilometers (approximately 1.7 miles) long and shows part of the edge of the south polar residual cap in enhanced color. Illumination is from the lower right. <br><br>The relatively bright, grayish areas are the residual cap, and the darker, reddish areas are mostly likely covered by dust.  The south polar residual cap is made, for the most part, of carbon dioxide ice (commonly called "dry ice") and dust, with a little water ice in some places.<br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005571_0950_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage,</a> one can see fractures in the residual cap ice near the margin and, farther in, circular depressions that, in some places, appear to have coalesced. These depressions constitute what is called "Swiss cheese terrain." and it's fairly easy to see why. The Swiss cheese terrain is created when the carbon dioxide goes directly from the solid state (ice) to a gaseous state (the more familiar carbon dioxide gas) as temperatures warm during south polar summer. Swiss cheese formation may also be linked in a complicated way to the behavior of major Martian dust storms.<br><br>Images like these, taken before and after dust storm events, can aid our understanding of that complicated relationship.
PSP_005574_1720	This image shows slope streaks and layering on the walls of a valley along the border between the Martian southern highlands and northern lowlands (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005574_1720_cut_b.jpg'><strong>see the subimage</strong></a>). At the bottom of the valley and in the lower portion of the valley walls are many large dunes.<br><br>The slope streaks generally start at a point source and widen downslope as a single streak or branch into multiple streaks. Some of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders. In particular, several of the slope streaks in this image appear to be diverting around individual dunes, with downslope movement occurring in the low troughs between the dunes. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that are lightening with time as new dust is deposited on their surface.<br><br>Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. Since the slope streaks in this image appear to superpose (lie on top of) the surfaces between individual dunes, the streaks most likely formed more recently and are younger than the dunes. <br><br>Many hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of slope streaks including dry avalanching, geochemical weathering, liquid stains or flows, and moisture wickering. Recent observations from HiRISE images have revealed that the dark interior of slope streaks is lower in elevation than the surroundings, suggesting that material must have been removed in the formation of the streak.

Four dust fans have emerged from the spider's channels. Translucent ice is warmed from below, and evaporates below the seasonal ice layer. The gas finds a weak spot and vents to the top of the ice layer above, carrying dust from the surface along. The dust is blown around by the prevailing wind.  <br><br><a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_002942_0935_cut_c.jpg'>Subimage 3</a> (<a href='/PSP_002942_0935'>PSP_002942_0935</a>) was acquired at Ls = 199.6.

All seasonal frost is gone. It is clear that channels are carved into the surface, not the seasonal ice. Fans have disappeared in the sense that they no longer contrast with the very surface material that they came from in the first place. The surface material is water-ice cemented dirt covered with a layer ~5 cm deep of desiccated silt-sized dust, which is redistributed every season in this process of fan creation and deposition.

PSP_005583_1700	This image shows a terraced fan (center left) located adjacent to a short valley. Terraced fans are rare deposits on Mars: they have only been seen in a few dozen locations.<br><br>On Earth, terraced fans are found in alluvial environments and in deltas. When water flowing down steep slopes, such as mountains or hills, encounters a flatter surface, the sediments carried by the water are deposited along the shallow slopes to form alluvial fans. Deltas can also produce terraced fans when water from rivers and streams meets oceans or lakes; a delta deposit results at the contact between the confined, fast-moving water (river/stream) and the open body of water (ocean/lake). <br><br>The fact that this Martian terraced fan is found adjacent to a valley supports the hypothesis that water was the mechanism that transported and deposited the material that now forms the fan. It is unclear, however, if this fan formed in an alluvial or deltaic environment, or by some other process.

PSP_005609_1470	Channels associated with impact craters were once thought to be quite rare. Scientists proposed a variety of unusual circumstances to explain them, such as impacts by comets or precipitation caused by the impact event. As more of Mars is photographed with high-resolution imagery, more craters surrounded by channel systems are being discovered.<br><br>The channels in this HiRISE image are from Hale Crater, an exceptionally well-preserved 125 x 150 kilometer (approximately 78 x 93 mile) impact crater located on the northern rim of the Argyre Basin. Hale Crater is roughly 170 kilometers (100 miles) to the southeast. <br><br>The channels <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/images/2009/details/cut/PSP_005609_1470_cut.jpg'><strong>in this subimage</strong></a> are up to about 250 meters (820 feet) across, though most are much smaller. The channels appear to emanate directly from Haleís ejecta, and were likely formed by the impact event. The heat of the impact could have melted large amounts of subsurface ice, and generated surface runoff capable of carving the channels.<br><br>If a significant amount of water was released or mobilized by the formation of the Hale Crater impact, larger impacts that formed during the early days of the Solar System may have been able to bring even more water to the surface of Mars. If this is true, a long-term, stable, warm and wet climate may not be required to explain the presence of such channels in the ancient Martian landscapes.<br><br>

PSP_005620_1210	This image shows the west wall of a southern hemisphere crater. The scene is covered in dust devil tracks which appear as dark wispy features.<br><br>Dust devils are small-scale funnels that move across the surface kicking up dust as they go, thus leaving trails. The crater is covered in small polygons in many locations. These polygons are probably related to <a href='science_themes/glacial.php'><strong>periglacial processes;</strong></a> for example, temperature cycling of ice-rich material or sublimation, when gases trapped under the surface escape causing the remaining terrain to collapse to form pits.<br><br>Also in this crater are several gullies on the southern wall. These gullies have very wide alcoves/source regions. It is unknown what is responsible for different gully alcove shapes and morphologies.
PSP_005622_1690	HiRISE image of a proposed landing ellipse for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) in Eos Chasma.
PSP_005632_1225	The terrain in this image is located in Amphitrites Patera, southwest  of Hellas Basin. This area constitutes the interior of an ancient impact crater that was filled by a layer of smooth material, possibly composed of ash and dust, mixed with interstitial ice (ice filling spaces between dust and ash grains). <br><br>The curved ridge toward the top of the image is a remnant of the crater rim that was exhumed by erosion of the filling material. The morphology (appearance and shape) of the small, scalloped depressions, which we observe within the smooth material, suggests that the erosion process was sublimation (the process of a material going directly from a solid state to a gaseous state).<br><br>Scalloped depressions are a typical feature of the mid-latitudes of Mars between 40 and 60 degrees latitude. They usually have a steep <br>pole-facing scarp (cliff), displaying series of small pits and fractures and a gentler, smoother, equator-facing slope. This asymmetry is most likely due to differences in solar heating. The large scalloped depressions appear to have formed from the coalescing of multiple, smaller scalloped depressions. Their formation may be an ongoing process, although no definitive evidence has been uncovered so far.<br>

PSP_005658_1760	This caption describes two images that form a stereo-pair, that is often useful to study the same area at different times and to note any differences for further examination. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/winslow_changes.gif'>This animated image</a> demonstrates the principle of having a stereo-pair.<br><br>In the first HiRISE image of Winslow Crater (<a href='/PSP_004313_1760'> PSP_004313_1760</a>), <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_004313_1760_cut_b.jpg'>distinct dark rays surrounding the crater</a> and are consistent with the THEMIS dataís suggestion of rockier materials. V-shaped patterns in the rays ó referred to as a ìherringboneî pattern ó are identical to those around fresh lunar craters. These form when materials are ejected from the crater at a very low angle, which form clusters of secondary craters that preferentially eject materials down-range in a V-shaped pattern. (Itës the same pattern that you would get when shooting a water pistol nearly parallel to a sidewalk.)<br><br>Also noteworthy are the large meter-to-decimeter-sized boulders on the  steep rim that have not been buried or physically weathered to smaller sizes in this windy region, indicating that they have not been exposed long. This is also reminiscent of Meteor Crater and examples of fresh simple craters on the Moon.<br><br>The ring of rocky, cliff-forming materials in the inner wall of the crater represents original bedrock that was uplifted and exposed by the impact. The characteristic morphology is called ìspur and gullyî consisting of both the protruding bedrock inter-fingered with debris shoots feeding fans of sandy materials that extend down to the crater floor. Throughout this region, the present-day surface consists of a mix of global dust and volcanic sands from the Syrtis Major complex that typically cover the local bedrock. Winslow Crater is an excellent example of how craters can provide a window into the subsurface by exposing the local bedrock within the ejecta and crater wall.<br><br><strong>Second Image</strong><br>Later, this second HiRISE image of Winslow (PSP_005658_1760) was <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005658_1760_cut_b.jpg'>taken to obtain a stereo-pair</a> useful for determining the relief and topography of the crater and its surroundings. By chance this second image was taken after the dust storm that enveloped the planet in June 2007. Dust deposited during this storm blanketed the region and largely obscured the brightness differences between the dark rays and the surrounding bright soil. Laboratory experiments on natural surfaces indicate that a layer of dust only a few tens of microns thick is sufficient to achieve such obscuration. The thin dark lines that cross the later image show that dust-devils have already begun the work of cleansing the surface of dust and restoring the region to its previous appearance. <br><br><strong>Naming the Crater</strong><br>Due to its similar size and remote thermal infrared (TIR) characteristics similar to Meteor Crater, Arizona, the name Winslow Crater was suggested after the small town roughly 20 km to the east of Meteor Crater, and the International Astronomical Unionís committee on Planetary Nomenclature agreed. (For further information on Planetary Nomenclature <a href='http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/'>click here</a>).<br>
PSP_005680_1525	The ancient cratered highlands of the southern hemisphere of Mars has an intriguing and complex history as it has been riddled with impact craters and modified by volcanic processes and by the wind.<br><br>Additionally, it is one of the most heavily dissected terrains on Mars exhibiting the densest population of valley networks: old dried up channels and valleys that may have been formed by surface runoff, the seepage of ground water, or both.<br><br>Recently, the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) aboard Mars Odyssey (MO), in conjunction with spectral data from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) have revealed the presence of a unique surface deposit that may be rich in chloride salts formed from the presence of liquid water. Three separate missions (MGS, MO and MRO) have come to reveal the composition and nature of these unique deposits, which, although they occur as relatively small deposits (less than 25 square kilometers) are widely distributed in Noachian (most ancient) terrains with fewer occurrences in the Hesperian (middle geologic time) terrains.<br><br>This HiRISE infrared color sub-image (approximately 900 meters wide) <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005680_1525_cut_b.jpg'>shown here</a> is part of one such deposit in an ancient partially buried unnamed crater in Terra Cimmeria, that shows this deposit in a light-toned almost fleshy color. The deposit appears to be relatively thin and occurs in low-lying areas. It is also heavily pockmarked and discontinuous, possibly from removal of the material by erosion. Both of these aspects suggest that the deposit is indeed very old.<br><br>The presence of such salts is intriguing, and strongly suggests that conditions were favorable for water near or at the surface in the geologic past. Polygonal cracks can be observed in this image and other images of these deposits elsewhere on Mars (<a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003160_1410'>PSP_003160_1410</a>) and are similar to desiccation cracks (formed from the rapid evaporation and drying of a wet surface) and indicate that these may were more likely deposited at the surface. However, the volume and duration the water required for these deposits is still being investigated. 
PSP_005682_1035	This image shows internal layering in the south polar layered deposits exposed on a scarp. The south polar layered deposits are composed primarily of water ice with a small amount of dust. Variations in dust content most likely control the erosion of the layers. <br><br>Some layers have an irregular wavy appearance that may have been caused by flow of the ice in the past when the now-exposed ice was still buried. It is currently too cold at the surface in the south polar region of Mars for significant flow to be occurring today. Other layers appear to be converging and some are truncated and may represent unconformities (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005682_1035_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). Unconformities form when a previous episode of erosion removes all or part of a layer and is later followed by more deposition.<br><br>The layers were laid down over a large area near the south pole, probably over the past few million years. They are believed to record recent global climate changes and oscillations on Mars in much the same way that polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide information about varying climatic conditions on Earth.
PSP_005684_1890	A set of dark sand dunes within the northeastern edge of a dune field in Nili Patera, a volcanic caldera in the Syrtis Major region of Mars is the focus of this HiRISE observation.<br><br>The <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005684_1890_cut_b.jpg'>lighter surface beneath the dunes</a></strong> is an ancient lava flow. The cracks in the flow probably formed when the lava cooled. Many of the cracks are dark and probably contain sand; the dark color of the dunes suggests that the sand is basaltic in composition and therefore originally derived from volcanic rock.<br><br>However, whether the sand formed from Nili Patera is not known, as it is possible the dunes have blown in from a more distal location. With two horns on one end and a rounded edge on the other, the dunes have a distinctive shape. The side of the dunes with the horns has a steeper slope &mdash; called the slip face &mdash and the rounded side exhibits a more shallow slope. These types of dunes are called &ldquo;barchans&rdquo; and, in analogy with similar dunes on Earth, form in areas with limited sand supply.<br><br>The horns of the barchans point in the downwind direction, indicating that the predominant surface winds in this region blew from the east-northeast (slightly upper right in the image). Zooming into the image, one can see landslides on many dune slip faces, indicating fairy recent slope failure. Very small ripples are visible on the dunes&rdquo; surfaces, showing that the winds in this region have not only blown the barchans across the lava plain, but also modified the dunes themselves.  Another HiRISE image, <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004339_1890'>PSP_004339_1890,</a> shows more barchan dunes in Nili Patera, south of this area.
PSP_005701_1920	This image shows a landslide along the margin of a small mesa in the Xanthe Terra region of Mars.<br><br>This particular landslide has many blocks and boulders on the surface. It is likely these large pieces of the mesa wall rock rafted downslope when the landslide occurred and not jumbled and pulverized into smaller sizes. This observation gives some insight into the possible physics involved in downslope transport of rock materials.<br><br>Landslides and other <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'><strong>mass wasting features</strong></a> are also important in the overall study of Mars as they give some indication of the stability of rock materials.<br>
PSP_005703_1750	This image shows a large outcrop of layered rock in Tithonium Chasma, a part of the Valles Marineris trough system. <br><br>Light, layered sediments are found at many sites on the floor of Valles Marineris. Observations drawn from this image will help understand the history of deposition at this location, and can be compared with nearby related rocks. <br><br>A light-toned unit (tan in the RGB color image) is found through most of the image. At high resolution, this unit often shows thin layers; it resembles light deposits found at many other sites. The light-toned materials are overlain by a dark unit (blue in the RBG color) that may have been deposited over the lighter rock much later. Variations in tone and color may indicate deviations in rock properties, such as the source material, cementation, or deposition process; in some cases they may simply be due to varying amounts of dust cover. <br><br>It is still unclear how the layered rocks in Valles Marineris formed. They might be sediments laid down in lakes or streams, wind-deposited, or volcanic materials. All of these processes can form layered rocks on Earth. <br><br>The dark material in the western part of the image appears to have once been a continuous layer over the current topography, now being eroded; if it was indeed draped, rather than laid down horizontally, it was most likely formed by dust or volcanic ash settling uniformly out of the atmosphere. 
PSP_005709_1405	This image shows several gullies along the southern wall of unnamed crater in the eastern Hellas region of Mars. This particular crater has gullies on both the polar and equatorial-facing walls.<br><br>The gully floors appear to be filled with rough-textured, somewhat knobby-looking materials. As multiple gullies located upslope feed into a single gully reaching the crater floor, the materials have converged to form a large deposit. Lineations parallel to apparent flow direction are evident on the textured surface.<br><br>It's not clear if liquid flows carved the gullies at this location, but the eastern Hellas region is well known for its abundant ice-rich flow features, such as lobate debris aprons at the base of knobs and massifs. Thus, the gully floor materials may have also incorporated ice at some time in the recent past and moved downslope as possible glacial-like flows.
PSP_005710_1555	This image shows part of the floor of a large crater in Terra Tyrrhena. Here, dark mesas contrast with light-colored, topographically lower outcrops. <br><br>The mesas have sharp cliffs, indicating the dark materials are not loose, but rather consolidated; layering is also visible along the cliffs. The underlying light materials are also layered and profusely fractured. Their superposition relationship indicates that the light materials are older than the dark, mesa-forming materials.<br><br>The image also <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005710_1555_cut_b.jpg'>shows a number of crest-like features</a> criss-crossing the landscape. The fact that their relief is so prominent indicates they are more resistent to erosion (harder) than their surroundings. These crests could be indurated fractures (fractures cemented by fluids) or dikes. Dikes are tabular intrusions of rock formed when underground magma is injected along fractures. <br><br>The lowest regions in the image are covered by dark-colored dunes (see for instance the NW or upper left section of the image). These are possibly accumulations of fine-grained materials eroded-out from the mesas. 
PSP_005720_1885	This image shows several parallel segments of the Cerberus Fossae. This is a system of fissures formed by extension and stretching of the near-surface of Mars. It is associated with some of the most recent large-scale events on the planet. <br><br>The Athabasca Valles channel system has its source at one segment of the Cerberus Fossae. This channel was most likely carved by a massive flood of water, perhaps released by the same tectonic processes which formed the fossae. Cerberus Fossae then extruded a large lava flow that draped Athabasca Valles. HiRISE images were recently used to describe details of this history in a paper published in the journal Science (Jaeger et al., Science, volume 317). <br><br>In the RGB false-color, this image shows a striking contrast. The plains are a generally bland beige, while the floors of the fissures are bright blue. Since the fissure walls are cutting through the lava which makes up the plains, the blue color probably indicates relatively dust-free exposed rock, while the beige is due to dust coating the level plains. Although the Cerberus Fossae released lava in places, at this site there is no evidence for a vent and the fissures have simply cut through pre-existing lava.
PSP_005748_1075	This image of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) shows some of the layers cut off against other layers below and right of center. Geologists call this an ìangular unconformityî because the layers do not conform to each other across this boundary.<br><br>In this case, the angular unconformity was probably caused by erosion of the SPLD followed by deposition of new SPLD on top of the eroded surface, but faulting could also have caused the observed unconformity. Near the unconformity <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005748_1075_cut_b.jpg'>is an impact crater,</a> one of dozens found on the SPLD. The presence of these craters implies that the surface of the SPLD has been relatively stable (i.e., little erosion or deposition) in the past few million years. This is in stark contrast to the north polar layered deposits, on which craters are very rare, implying very recent erosion/deposition.

PSP_005788_1035	This image of the south polar layered deposits (SPLD) shows evidence of multiple episodes of deposition and erosion near the base of those deposits.<br><br>The SPLD, like the north polar layered deposits, are thought to contain a record of global climate changes on Mars. The surface of the outcrop shown here slopes generally toward the right. The layering at the bottom of the image is cut off by deposits that partly fill two broad valleys that were previously cut into the SPLD, probably by wind erosion. These more recent deposits appear to cover the flatter, upper part of the SPLD at left, and have also been eroded to expose layering with them.
PSP_005799_1505	This image shows an impact crater in the southern hemisphere of Mars with striking mass wasting features on the northern wall. (Mass wasting is the general term for a variety of processes in which rock or soil moves downhill). <br><br>Several dark, nearly continuous layers of rock ring the upper part of the crater slope. In the northern part of the layer, dark downslope striations can be seen even at low resolution. At the full resolution of HiRISE, these are seen to be comprised mostly of boulders. In several cases the striations descend directly from rocky outcrops, and they form due to rocks breaking and falling from the outcrops near the rim. This demonstrates the relative instability of the steep slopes of young craters; this is an important process in crater degradation. The dark streaks in this case may indicate particularly steep slopes.
PSP_005813_2150	This unusual depression and the associated concentric rings are situated within an area thought to have been deposited as a mud flow. Due to the lack of a distinctive, raised rim or other impact-related features, this crater is thought to have formed by the loss of material below the surface and subsequent collapse, rather than by an impact from space.<br><br>The exact mechanism for the loss of material is not fully understood, although the missing material was likely water in some form. This feature is near a large volcano, so perhaps there were explosive magma-water interactions that violently removed the water and some magma, followed by surface collapse. Or, less violently, there could have been simple melting of subsurface ice and then collapse of the surface into the resulting void. The rays emanating from the depression suggest some amount of violence before the surface collapse that sprayed material far from the depression.<br><br>Some aspects of this and other, nearby features are similar to the collapse pits associated with <a href='http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1703-01='>Gr&iacute;msv&ouml;tn </a>volcano in Iceland, which erupts beneath an ice-cap.

It depicts light-colored bedrock and darker wind deposits. This is a <a href='http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/compositor/'> false-color </a> image, enhanced to exaggerate the contrast between units.<br><br>The bedrock appears tan-colored and shows subtle signs of layering in places; see, for instance, the butte in the southwestern portion of the color subimage. Layering in terrestrial formations usually indicates that the rock-forming materials were deposited by wind or water.<br><br>The bedrock is crisscrossed by a dense network of rectilinear (lines that are parallel or at right angles) fractures; some can be followed for hundreds of meters. The fractures look bluish in color, indicating that they are occupied by materials that are somehow different from the bedrock. Perhaps wind-carried materials got trapped in the depressed fracture zones.<br><br>The two large, feather-shaped deposits towards the southeastern corner of the subimage are younger dune deposits. Dunes form when loose sand-sized materials are transported and deposited by a moving fluid, in this case wind. Their color&mdash;similar to that of the materials in the fractures&mdash;indicates that they did not originate from erosion of the local bedrock.

PSP_005881_1465	This image features a crater at the head of Dao Vallis, one of the Martian outflow channels that drains into Hellas Basin.<br><br>The outflow channels are believed to have been sculpted by giant floods of ground water erupting from the subsurface. The crater has a series of ripples on the west side of its floor that likely formed when gravity made ice-rich material slide off the crater walls into the center. <br><br>There are several small craters visible on the larger craterís floor. Some circular features that no longer have raised rims are probably relaxed craters. Relaxed craters are more evidence that this was once&mdash;and might still be&mdash;an ice-rich area.<br>
PSP_005893_1060	The bright band running diagonally through the center of this image is a sun-facing scarp exposing the south polar layered deposits (SPLD).<br><br>Near the top of the scarp, dozens of pits are visible in the SPLD. Based on <a href='http://www.marsis.com/'>Mars Express MARSIS</a> and <a href='http://www.sharad.org/'>MRO SHARAD</a> radar observations, the SPLD are probably rich in water ice. It is therefore possible that these pits were formed by evaporation and escape of water from beneath the surface of the SPLD, followed by collapse into the voids created by removal of water ice.<br><br>The surface of the SPLD is typically covered by dust, protecting the underlying water ice from evaporation. It is not clear why the water ice  would have evaporated and escaped from the pits in this area&mdash;perhaps the scarp is steep enough that the SPLD are being pulled down slope by gravity.
PSP_005897_1790	This image shows a small crater in the northwest part of Schiaparelli Crater, near the equator of Mars. The small crater (roughly 2 kilometers in diameter, similar to Meteor Crater in Arizona) was filled with light, layered sediments that are now exposed as bulls-eye rings within the crater. <br><br>Moving out from the crater center, the layers appear to be stair-stepped so that each layer is slightly lower than the previous one; the innermost layers are the youngest, deposited on top of a stack of sediments. The concentric pattern could be simply due to each layer being eroded slightly more than the one below it, but another factor may be the shape of the layers. If each layer draped over the interior of the crater and the region was eroded to a nearly flat surface, the layers would appear as a succession of rings. Topographic data of sufficient resolution would enable us to distinguish between these two models.  <br><br>If the layers are draped, this provides some information about how they formed. Dust or volcanic ash settling from the atmosphere is likely to drape the surface; by contrast, deposits from rivers or lakes are likely to fill preferentially in the low areas. <br><br>In the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_005800_005899/PSP_005897_1790/PSP_005897_1790_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>RGB false-color image,</strong></a> much of the layered material appears pale. Some layers appear dark blue or red-brown in places; this may be due in part to trapping of wind-blown material in troughs or on rough surfaces. Ridges on the surface appear to protect it  from erosion. These could be ripples of sand formed by wind and later hardened, or resistant fins called ìdeformation bandsî created by rock deformation.
PSP_005904_1725	The Memnonia Sulci region is southeast of Elysium Planitia at the boundary between the smooth lowlands and cratered southern highlands. <br><br>This region is characterized by yardangs, which are ridges formed by wind erosion of the regional deposits. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005904_1725_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage,</a> you can see the individual layers of these deposits. These are commonly believed to be fine ash layers but they could also be sedimentary in origin, deposited either by wind or water. Some isolated patches of dunes are also visible throughout the image, abutting the ridges of the yardangs.

PSP_005924_2210	The Cydonia region on Mars is located in Arabia Terra at the boundary between the Northern lowlands and Southern highlands. This region gained notoriety when Viking imaged a landform that looked like a face.<br><br>The ìfaceî has subsequently been imaged by many orbiters, including HiRISE (<a href='PSP_003234_2210'><strong> PSP_003234_2210</strong></a>), showing that it is simply a rocky mound, and the face-like appearance was due to a trick of shadows.  This observation was taken of a region slightly to the southwest of that landform.<br><br>This region is characterized by knobs and buttes. Knobs are rounded hills and buttes are hills with steep vertical sides and a flat top. A butte is similar to a plateau, but smaller in scale. These are features that are resistant to erosion, and there are several ways that such features may become more resistant than the surrounding areas. They can be plutonic intrusions or volcanic rocks that are more resistant rock types than the surrounding sedimentary rock. Alternatively, these regions may be resistant because they have been cemented by water carrying dissolved ions that precipitate as minerals binding the sediment together. Either way, they provide important information about the geologic history of the region.<br><br>Of note in this image is the <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_005924_2210_cut,jpg'><strong>interesting pitted and patterned ground</strong></a>. This pitting may have resulted from the sublimation of interstitial ice. (Sublimation is a process by which a solid form turns directly to a gas.) Patterned ground is common throughout the northern mid-latitude plains.
PSP_005930_1395	Visible here are gullies on the northeast rim of a southern hemisphere crater. Most of the gullies are cut deeply into the crater wall and have narrow channels.<br><br>Several of the gully channels have curves&mdash;known as meanders&mdash;that might indicate that the material the gullies flowed through was easily eroded.  The head of many of the gullies can be traced back to the layers exposed on the wall, suggesting that groundwater trickled out of the layers onto the slope.<br><br>The floor of the crater contains dark sand dunes as well as some arcuate ridges (wavy features) at the base of the gullies.  Arcuate ridges are proposed to be evidence of gravity-driven movement of ice-rich material from the crater walls onto the floor.<br>
PSP_005939_1720	This observation shows a sequence of layered sedimentary rocks exposed along the wall of Ganges Chasma.<br><br>Ganges Chasma is in the northeast part of the Valles Marineris system and cuts through surrounding plains interpreted to have been resurfaced by flowing lava. The Chasma is believed to have formed due to the collapse of plateau rocks along fault systems. <br><br>The plateau above the chasma is at the left side of the image and the wall of the trough descends to the east.<br><br>The layered sequence consists of many beds that are generally horizontal and laterally continuous. Some more pronounced layers appear to be weathering to form large-scale boulders (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005939_1720_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). Many thinner layers are apparent near the top of the wall. Material has also formed spurs and ridges along the wall of the trough. 
PSP_005946_0975	This scene is 6 kilometers (approximately 3.7 miles) wide, illuminated from the lower right, and shows a section of the south polar layered deposits.<br><br>The south polar layered deposits are an accumulation of mostly water ice and dust, similar in some ways to ice caps like those in Greenland and Antarctica. <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_005946_0975_cut_b.jpg'>In this example,</a> the layers in the lower right end abruptly (truncate) at a curve in the layers that extend along the left side of the image.  This type of truncation (termed an "unconformity" in geology) is usually due to erosion, wherein the layers in the lower right were eroded, followed by later deposition of the rest of the layers on top of the older layers (layer age likely increases from left to right). It is also possible that flow of these icy layers played a part in the complicated layer geometry exhibited in this example.

PSP_005965_1855	Shalbatana Vallis is a large channel that may be the result of lake formation and subsequent drainage from Ganges Chasma. <br><br>The valley has steep walls and a flat floor. Recently, a section of the steep wall collapsed and produced a landslide into the valley floor. This HiRISE image appears to show the source of this landslide to be a collapsed spur. The newly exposed surface has little dust coverage and is more blue in color when compared to the surrounding surface. It therefore appears quite fresh. <br><br>The debris in the valley floor is also interesting; the edges of the debris flow appear to be quite steep and surrounded by dunes. 
PSP_005980_1725	This observation shows a pit in the Noctis Labyrinthus region. Noctis Labyrintnus ("Labyrinth of Night") lies at the western end of Valles Marineris. <br><br>It is a jumbled "checkerboard" terrain consisting of short, narrow canyons that create a mosaic of heavily fractured blocks of the Martian crust. The origin of Noctis Labyrinthus is uncertain but it is believed to have formed by tectonic forces (crustal movements) and extensive faulting related to volcanic activity in the adjoining <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/apotelesmata.php?q=tharsis&order=release_date&submit=Search'>Tharsis region.</a> As cracks and faults opened, ice and ground water in the subsurface may have escaped, forming troughs and pits.<br><br>The pit in this image has exposed older material that was laid down in many layers. The layers can be seen particularly well in the upper walls of the pit. Many of the layers appear to be relatively thin and light toned and a few layers appear to be eroding into large boulders. <br><br>Several large, high albedo dunes are present on the floor of the pit and on the surface surrounding it.
PSP_006005_2050	This image was suggested by Kathleen Hartrum's middle school science club at Conestoga Middle School in Beaverton, Oregon.  They thought that this region looked like a fork in the river, separated by an island.  <br><br>This is, in fact, a streamlined island, one of many observed in the large outflow channels on Mars.  This outflow channel is called Kasei Valles, and is one of the largest catastrophic outflow channels on Mars. The streamlined island forms as water flows through the channel, but is blocked by some sort of obstacle, such as a crater or other topographic landform.  In this HiRISE image, we only see the very tail end of the streamlined island, which is over 118km in length.   <br><br>The platy surface within the channels has been attributed to either later lava or mud flows  along the surface.  The island itself is quite dusty and covered in small craters, so the island may be quite old.  Along the edge of the island, however, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006005_2050_cut.jpg'><strong>you can see individual layers of rock</strong></a>. These layers represent individual rock units that may be volcanic or sedimentary in origin.<br><br>
PSP_006006_1715	This observation shows parts of the upper walls of Valles Marineris with layered rocks. These layers extend down to a smooth-appearing slope, that is likely material shed from the upper parts of the chasm walls; down-slope stripes are visible, indicating that material has fallen or slid downhill in a process termed <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'>"mass wasting."</a> <br><br>The layers, exposed in most rock outcrops in this image, are most likely lava flows from flood lavas that once erupted across the region. These layers are located in the upper walls of most of Valles Marineris and are sometimes exposed at depths well below the surrounding plateau, recording extensive volcanism in the history of the region. Similar, thick successions of lava flows are found at some sites on Earth (for example, the Columbia River flood basalts in the northwest U.S.). <br>
PSP_006133_1410	Hellas is the deepest impact basin on Mars and perhaps in the Solar System. It is usually difficult to image the floor of Hellas because of atmospheric hazes, but sometimes it clears, as when this image was acquired.<br><br>This image shows some of the most complex deformed terrain on Mars. Initially, flat continuous layers of sediment were probably deposited, perhaps in a sea or from air fall. Subsequently the layers were squeezed and deformed into the strange patterns visible here. The layers appear to have bent and flowed rather than just broken via faulting, perhaps because the sediments were wet or rich in ice.
PSP_006148_1820	This observation shows rock outcrops in Meridiani Planum, in the area of the landing site of the <a href='http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/index.html'>Mars Exploration Rover,</a> Opportunity. The image is centered on a cluster of buttes, steep-sided erosional remnants protruding from a level plain. There are two broad categories of material in the image: light-toned sedimentary rock and dark-toned material, which is likely wind-blown sand. <br><br>The light-toned material was probably deposited as sediments transported by wind or water; Opportunity found outcrops of aeolian (wind-deposited) sandstone, and this may also be the case in the area of this image. The dark areas show ripples formed by material (probably grains of sand eroded from basaltic lava) blowing in the wind. <br><br>In the RGB enhanced-color image (which is not what the colors would like to the naked eye), the dark material is relatively blue, while the light rock ranges from pale blue to tan. The pale blue color in some cases may be due to small amounts of basaltic sand overlying relatively tan rock outcrops, but could also be a real difference due to varying composition or cementation of the rock.<br><br>The presence of buttes like those at the image center suggests rock layers of varying resistance. Relatively hard, resistant rock on top can armor a patch of weaker material below; this is commonly observed on Earth. Relations like this are found at many sites in the Colorado Plateau (the Four Corners area of the United States), which has been used as an analogue for this region on Mars. 
PSP_006151_0975	<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_006151_0975_cut_b.jpg'>This close up shows a complexly fractured</a> and grooved section of the south polar layered deposits. Illumination is from the lower right, and the scene is about 600 meters (approximately 650 yards) across.<br><br>The south polar layered deposits are an accumulation of mostly water ice and dust, similar in some ways to ice caps like those in Greenland and Antarctica.  In this example, the icy, dusty layers are barely visible, obscured by a complex system of ridges and fractures that formed after the layers were deposited.  The layers themselves are highlighted by sunlight and look like broad swales underlying the fracturing.<br><br>In the upper left of this example, one can see curvature in the layers which may have formed when the ice was flowing or which may have been due to collapse and slumping of some layers sometime after they were deposited but before they were fractured. The exact cause of the fracturing and grooving is unknown.
PSP_006162_1365	Lohse Crater is a heavily degraded southern hemisphere crater. This image cuts through its center. <br><br>The mounds on the left of the image are part of the craterís central peak, showing material that was uplifted during the late stages of its formation. The central peak hosts gullies that are  small-scale features of possible fluvial origin, although other origins are not as yet excluded. If they are fluvial, where could the water have come from? <br><br>There are many possibilities, but one idea in this case is that some water ice could have been trapped when the central peak formed, and that the ice was melted later to form the gullies. The faint, black, wispy lines criss-crossing slopes and terrain on the floor of the crater are dust devil tracks.  Dust devils are little cyclones that stir up dust as they travel across the surface.<br>
PSP_006223_1600	This observation shows wrinkle ridges in Hesperia Planum. Hesperia Planum encompasses a region of over two million square kilometers (over 770,000 square miles) in the southern highlands of Mars. It is located northwest of the Hellas basin and adjacent to Tyrrhena Patera and contains abundant orthogonal and intersecting wrinkle ridges. <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are linear to arcuate positive relief features and are often characterized by a broad arch topped with a crenulated ridge. These features have been identified on many planets such as the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and Venus. On Mars, they are many tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and have a relief of a few hundred meters. They commonly have asymmetrical cross sectional profiles and an offset in elevation on either side of the ridge.<br><br>Wrinkle ridges are most commonly believed to form from horizontal compression or shortening of the crust due to faulting and are often found in volcanic plains.
PSP_006234_1870	This observation shows lightly cratered plains in Elysium Planitia, which is a low-lying area located in the equatorial region of Mars. Part of an extensional (normal) fault system known as the Cerberus Fossae runs through the center of this image.<br><br>Elsewhere in Elysium Planitia, the Cerberus Fossae acted as a fissure-vent for erupting flood lavas, but here the geological activity appears to have been predominantly tectonic. Nonetheless, the raised, lobate (tongue-shaped) margin of an ancient lava flow is faintly discernible in the southern part of the image.<br><br>Near the center of the image, a few relatively deep depressions, partly filled with dark sand, are visible in the Cerberus Fossae. These are pit craters formed by collapse as normal faulting progressed. The largest pit crater is about 110 meters (360 feet) wide and about 300 meters (980 feet) long. Steep scarps along the perimeters of the pit craters and the linear margins of the Cerberus Fossae provide a cross-sectional view of the near-surface strata. The exposed material is rocky and has the tendency to break into large boulders that tumble downhill as erosion widens the troughs and depressions. A few low hills appear in the northern half of the image; dark streaks etch their flanks. These ìdark slope streaksî formed when small avalanches removed a surface layer of bright dust, exposing darker underlying materials. <br><br>The different shades of the streaks may reflect their relative ages, with darker slope streaks being fresher features.<br>
PSP_006237_1460	This image in a section of Dao Valles contains a multitude of landforms that may result from the actions of ice.  Aligned ridges on the valley floors are evidence of glacier-like flow of this material as it gets diverted around obstacles such as the valley walls and local mesas and knobs.<br><br>In some areas where the flow appears to have traveled over an obstacle instead of around, a series of fractures occur, analogous to crevasses that form in glaciers on Earth when ice flows over obstacles. The surface we see is covered with rocky debris and soil that may be protecting ice from sublimation (evaporation from ice to vapor). <br><br>Throughout the region the surface has been mantled by a smooth deposit that appears to have been eroded in a few locations. This sort of mantle is common at Martian high latitudes and is thought to be a mixture of dust and ice, either ice-cemented soil or very dirty snow. The eroded areas could be due to ice loss trough sublimation, leaving the remaining surface to collapse or be eroded by the wind.<br><br>Many gullies are observed that appear to be carved into the valley walls by liquid water. Incised channels in places cut deeply into the surface and fans of debris with crisscrossing small channels indicate where the flow of water slowed and deposited material eroded from upstream. The source of water is as yet unknown.  One theory has been proposed involving melting of surface ice or ice-rich soil in the cold Martian climate. Another theory suggests that an aquifer a few hundred meters (yards) below ground is feeding the gullies.
PSP_006243_0975	This image shows a portion of the south polar layered deposits near the base. Illumination is from the lower right, and the scene width is 6 kilometers (approximately 3.7 miles).<br><br>The south polar layered deposits are an accumulation of layers of mostly water ice and dust, similar in some ways to the ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica. Often, layers near the base of terrestrial ice caps are deformed because of ice flow and because of sliding of the ice on the underlying surface. On Mars, the polar layered deposits are likely frozen to the underlying materials, and thus do not slide. It is also likely too cold for the ice to flow very much.<br><br>These basal layers of the south polar layered deposits do <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_006243_0975_cut_b.jpg'>show some interesting wavy patterns</a> that may be due either to simple erosion or to some kind of flow and folding, possibly having occurred in the distant past. In the lower right hand corner some layers appear to be truncated against others, possibly indicating what is called an "unconformity," formed when layers are eroded and then new layers are deposited on top.  
PSP_006246_1910	Amazonis Planitia (seen in the northern half of this image) is one of the very flattest places on Mars. It is covered by vast floods of lava that have left a smooth lava plain.<br><br>The Medusae Fossae formation (seen in the southern half of this image) is a series of young wind-eroded deposits whose origin continues to be debated. It is generally thought to be composed of volcanic ash, perhaps like pumice on Earth.  However, some scientists hypothesize that it is an equatorial ice-rich deposit.  <br><br>In this image, it can be clearly seen that the Medusae Fossae formation is being eroded off of the Amazonis lavas.  Pristine lava features can be seen emerging on either side of the ridges of wind eroding material. The thin wiggly ridges on the lava plains are &ldquo;pressure ridges&rdquo; formed by bucking of the lava crust while it flowed.  The small cones, a few hundred meters or yards in diameter, that dot the lava plains formed when water underneath the lava turned to steam and exploded through the lava flow.<br><br>Today, these cones are still partly filled with Medusae Fossae formation materials. At least in this location, HiRISE finds no evidence for ice at or near the surface of the Medusae Fossae formation. Instead, the wind carved slopes are covered with dark streaks that formed as dry avalanches of dust.
PSP_006248_1235	This image shows a set of dark sand dunes within the northern part of an unnamed crater in the Terra Cimmeria region.<br><br>The dunes have a distinctive shape, with two horns on one end and a rounded edge on the other. The side of the dunes with the horns has a steeper slope and the rounded side a more shallow slope. These types of dunes are called &ldquo;barchans&rdquo; and, by analogy with similar dunes on Earth, form in areas with limited sand supply.<br><br>The horns of the barchans point in the downwind direction, thereby indicating that the predominant surface winds in this region blew from the east (right side of image). Further evidence of this wind regime is apparent when one zooms into the image. &ldquo;Wind tails&rdquo; are visible on the western (left) side of many rocks (many of these rocks may be ejecta from the degraded crater in the northern part of the image). Wind tails are formed by the accumulation of dust and sand in the lee of rocks, which act as wind shadows. Very small light ripples at a scale of a few meters (yards) are also apparent.<br><br>The dark, sinuous forms in the image are tracks left by dust devils, which lift bright dust off the surface, revealing the darker surface. Where dust devils cross the dunes, the fine texture on the dunes is undisturbed, indicating that the particles making up the dunes are coarse and fairly immobile.
PSP_006250_2200	Both ancient and modern deposits within craters in the northern lowlands area of Nilosyrtis are visible in this HiRISE observation. This crater <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006250_2200_cut_b.jpg'>and its neighbors</a></strong> are partially filled with sediments that display unusual morphologies, having patterned interiors and radial filaments.<br><br>The crater centers are occupied by heavily eroded mounds of material that probably once buried the craters in this region. <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006250_2200_cut_c.jpg'>Horizontal layering</a></strong> is visible in similar mounds elsewhere in this image, and close inspection <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006250_2200_cut_d.jpg'>shows that these mounds</a></strong> are covered by rocks, presumably ejecta from distant impacts.<br><br>The accumulation of ejecta on their surfaces indicates that the mounds are not recent deposits of dust or sand, but rather are ancient sediments perhaps deposited in a primordial sea. The radial filaments are much more recent deposits, as shown by the lack of ejecta on their surfaces, and are likely made up of dust and sand that is trapped between the older mounds and the crater walls.
PSP_006252_2220	Flow patterns dominate this region of Mars in Dueteronilus Mensae. Many of the valley floors in the area exhibit complex alignments of small ridges, hills, and pits ñ often called &ldquo;lineated valley fill.&rdquo; The cause of the small-scale texture is not known, but it may result from patterns in ice rich soils or the loss of ice.<br><br>The linear alignment we see is probably caused by downhill movement of ice-rich soil, or glacial flow in dirty ice or ice-rich soil. The result is flow patterns, called &ldquo;stream lines,&rdquo; that follow the valleys and around obstacles. Many of the large knobs and mesas in this region are also surrounded by aprons of debris that appear to have flowed away from the knobs and may be ice-rich themselves.  Around one large knob in this image the debris flow appears to lie on top of the lineated valley fill and is therefore probably a younger deposit.
PSP_006254_1885	This observation shows a variety of wind-related features near the equator of Mars in northern Meridiani Planum.<br><br>Two <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006254_1885_cut_b.jpg'>distinct types of dark sand dunes</a></strong> are visible in this picture. The isolated dunes near the edge of the dune field are called barchans, and their shapes can be used to determine the wind direction. These barchans are about 200 meters (656 feet) across and display steep edges on their southwest sides, indicating that they are driven by northeasterly winds. This agrees with the orientation of the bright wind streak issuing from the crater at the top right of the picture, formed from bright dust eroding from the crater interior.<br><br>Towards the middle of the dune field, the shape of the dunes alters to the second type of dunes, known as &ldquo;transverse&rdquo; dunes. These are long ridges of sand that are oriented perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction, and tend to form where there is an abundant supply of sand. A <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006254_1885_cut_c.jpg'>closeup of the transition zone</a></strong>  suggests that the individual barchans first merge into groups of two or three before the groups merge to form ridges.<br><br>Several indications suggest that the sand here is on the move. Sand fills small pits and polygonal fractures in the bedrock, indicating recent sand movement between the dunes. The transitioning dune types and the presence of outliers (dunes that form away from the main dune field) both suggest possible dune migration.<br><br>HiRISE will continue to monitor areas such as this over time, in order to quantify the rate of sand movement on Mars.
PSP_006261_1410	This observation features a relatively pristine crater in the southern mid-latitudes. The crater still has a sharp rim on its south end, but it has experienced modification since forming.<br><br>The north half of the crater is populated by a large number of gullies that appear to emanate from resistant layers.  The layers likely continue around the crater, but the gullies do not. Distinct layers are visible on the south wall of the crater. It is unknown why gullies form on certain slopes and not others. Interestingly, the gullies themselves are not so pristine. They are covered by dunes and cut by polygonal fractures, indicating that they have been modified by aeolian (wind-driven) and periglacial (ground ice) processes, respectively.<br><br>There are a large number of boulder tracks visible on the crater walls. Boulder tracks typically are approximately constant in width, and can often be seen at the track ends. The crater floor has a texture indicative of sublimation processes. (Sublimation is when something goes directly from a solid to a gas phase, skipping a liquid phase.) If a soil is ice-rich under Martian conditions, the ice can sublimate causing the ground to collapse and &ldquo;crinkle&rdquo; where the ice used to be.
PSP_006262_1080	This observation shows internal layering exposed in a basal section (bottom part) of the polar layered deposits. The south polar layered deposits are composed primarily of water ice with a small amount of dust. <br><br>Variations in dust content most likely controls the erosion of the layers. The layers were laid down over a large area near the south pole, probably over the past few million years. They are believed to record recent global climate changes on Mars in much the same way that polar ice in Greenland and Antarctica provide information about varying climatic conditions on Earth.<br><br>Several layers appear to be truncated (<a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_006262_1080_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>) and most likely represent unconformities.  Unconformities form when an episode of erosion that removes all or part of a layer is followed by more deposition.<br>
PSP_006268_1995	This image shows part of the surface of Chryse Planitia, near the mouth of several of the giant outflow channels carved by massive floods. At this location the channel is much too large to be seen within a HiRISE image, and this shows an area of level plains near the mouth. <br><br>Two geologic units are visible at this site: a relatively dark expanse in the southern part of the image, and a light, slightly higher-standing area along the northern edge. The light unit may be material that has flowed out from below the surface in a process called mud volcanism. However, many aspects of the history of the northern plains of Mars remain uncertain. <br><br>A few other prominent features are present. A long trough with aeolian (wind-blown) ripples runs through the eastern part of the image. This feature likely formed by contraction of the surface layer. This must have occurred after the formation of the light material since it cuts through the light unit in the northwest part of the image. There is also a large mound which appears to bury part of the trough, and thus is even younger. Alternatively, two troughs could both terminate at the hill.<br><br>Despite the resolution of HiRISE, the nature of this mound is still unclear. It has a rugged surface, which might mean that it has been eroded enough to remove indications of its origin.  <br>
PSP_006270_0955	A wide variety of south polar terrains are on display in this spectacular HiRISE color image. The reddish material in the upper two thirds of the image is the south polar layered deposits (SPLD). These deposits are a stack of layered, dusty water ice.  Scientists believe that these layers record previous climatic conditions on Mars, much like terrestrial ice-sheets provide a record of climate change on the Earth. <br><br>This image shows the face of one of the many scarps or shallow cliffs that cut into the polar layered deposits. These scarps expose the internal layers within the SPLD. You can see these climate-recording layers in the upper two thirds of the image running from lower-left to upper-right.<br><br>The terrain in the lower third of the image is quite different in both appearance and composition. The bright, white-ish material is a thin covering of carbon dioxide ice draped over the flat areas of the SPLD. This covering of carbon dioxide is being eroded away by expanding flat-floored pits. Parts of the floors of these pits show the reddish brown coloring of the underlying polar layered deposits. These pits have eroded the carbon dioxide ice layer to such an extent that only isolated mesas remain today and even these shrink in extent by a few meters each year.<br><br>These mesas also have several layers within them, indicting that they likely contain a climatic record, albeit a much shorter one than preserved in the SPLD. Most of the isolated mesas have white-ish tops; however, some (near the foot of the SPLD scarp) have reddish tops. This may either be due to bright carbon dioxide ice thinning to reveal the older (and darker) carbon dioxide ice that makes up the main body of the mesa, or perhaps dust has settled out of the atmosphere to cover the brighter frost. There was a large Martian dust storm earlier this year which could have caused either effect.
PSP_006271_2210	These unusual craters were spotted in Arcadia Planitia, which is part of an extensive region of Mars blanketed by a thick layer of bright dust.<br><br>Light southeasterly winds during southern spring and summer blow the dust towards the northwest (top left of the picture in the cutout above). The dust is trapped temporarily in the lee of crater rims, both inside the craters and along the outside rims where they form streamers that <a href='images/2007/details/cut/PSP_006271_2210_cut_b.jpg'>resemble St. Nickís beard</a>.<br>
PSP_006278_2225	Unusual surface patterns near the center of Moreux Crater suggest a complicated history of glacial flow. A series of ridges and troughs originating from the crater&rsquo;s central peak to the west of this image terminate in this area in a jumble of twisted patterns and circular depressions.<br><br>The superposition of impact craters and sand dunes on top of these ridges and troughs suggests that the flow patterns are old and that any ice may be largely gone. The round depressions may have formed when large sections of relatively clean ice were left in place to melt or sublimate (evaporating ice directly to gas). The ridges would be analogous to moraines in Earth glaciers, formed from rock and debris mixed with the ice that flow with the glacier.<br><br>The complicated and twisting patterns indicate that the ice flowed into this area, which is at a lower elevation on the crater floor, and piled up behind itself as the flow stalled. Numerous boulders are also scattered over the surface of ridges and troughs. Boulders may have been carried into place with the ice and as the ice was removed, the boulders were left in place.
PSP_006284_1145	This image shows a dark dune field in Smith Crater. The dark color of the dunes indicates that they are probably made of basaltic sand, a dark volcanic rock that is common on Mars. This is in contrast to dunes on Earth, which are dominated by quartz, a rare mineral on Mars. <br><br>The dunes here are ìtransverse dunesî that, based on analogy with similar features on Earth, form by winds that blow in a direction perpendicular to the crests. However, Secondary ripples on top of the dunes are oriented at right angles; that indicates a second wind regime that has redistributed the sand after the original dunes formed. The multiple orientations of the dunes may be partly caused by their location within the  crater, whose own topography can act to redistribute regional wind patterns.<br><br>The dark streaks on the lighter terrain outside of the dune field are interpreted as dust devil tracks, where mini-tornadoes reveal darker ground beneath the bright dust of the surface. Some long dust devil tracks are visible  in the southern part of the dune field and climb onto the troughs of the transverse dunes. There are also a few faded tracks at the northern part of the dune field.
PSP_006475_1525	This observation shows part of a large region of layered rocks in Terby Crater, in the southern highlands of Mars. The layers show variation in thickness, brightness, and color, suggesting a diverse history. <br><br>Sedimentary rocks on Mars are often relatively light-toned. At this site both light and dark materials are visible. Light outcrops are exposed in many places, particularly in the sides of the large mesas (flat-topped hills) in this area. Light and dark layers alternate at some levels. In several places the mesas are capped by darker rock that is breaking into boulders; these layers are probably relatively strong and resistant, and help armor the mesa against erosion. <br><br>There is also a widespread, relatively dark layer that appears to mantle much of the area and drape some of the steeper slopes. This unit is relatively young and unconsolidated. It must have been deposited after most of the erosion here had occurred since it drapes the slopes, and the patchy nature suggests that it erodes relatively easily. <br><br>In many cases it is hard to determine the nature of the layers; deposits from lakes, rivers, sand dunes, or volcanic ash can form layered deposits. It is possible that several processes have contributed to the rocks here. However, one area suggests past fluvial (stream or river) deposition.<br><br>Near the center of the image, there is a region of long, sinuous ridges, once buried and now exposed by erosion. These may be old stream beds, which can turn into ridges if the bed material is coarser or better-cemented than the rocks around it. 
PSP_006477_1745	Dust-devils are vortices of wind that form when air rising from a warm surface encounters shear in the above atmosphere. Martian dust devils can attain gargantuan proportions, reaching the size of terrestrial tornadoes with plumes that tower up to 9 kilometers above the surface. Dust-devils play an important role in sustaining the aerosols that make up Mars&rsquo; red sky and in cleaning the Martian surface after a dust storm.<br><br>This observation shows a region near the Martian equator that is <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006477_1745_cut_b.jpg'>a perfect tablet for the scribblings of dust-devils.</a></strong> This region is made up of dark bedrock that is thinly blanketed by bright dust. Dark tracks form when dust-devils scour the surface, exposing the darker substrate. The tracks tend to cluster together, as dust-devils repeatedly form over terrain that has been previously scoured and is consequently darker and warmer than the surrounding surface.<br><br>Once lofted by a dust-devil, the fine dust can be transported great distances before it settles again onto the surface.
PSP_006487_1580	This image was suggested by Ehsan Sanaei's high school astronomy club in Yazd, Iran.  <br><br>They noticed a set of craters around the rim of Tyrrhena Patera. Tyrrhena Patera is a volcano in the southern highlands with shallow slopes, and only 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) of vertical relief. The craters are aligned and are known as pit crater chains. These are common in volcanic regions on Mars.<br><br>They are not formed by a meteorite impact, but by collapse into some void space underground. Because the pit crater chains and concentric fractures are generally aligned, these are most likely due to extension in the region, where parts of the Martian crust pull apart during growth of the volcano or emplacement of dikes. <br><br>Another way pit crater chains can occur is when lava tubes partially collapse forming chains of holes along the roof of the lava tube. A third possibility is that these may be associated with collapse of the magma chamber.  <br>
PSP_006494_1535	This observation shows a wrinkle ridge in the Solis Planum, a region of Mars that is a high-elevation volcanic plain located south of the Valles Marineris canyon system and east of the Tharsis volcanic complex. In the Solis Planum, wrinkle ridges are typically spaced apart roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles).<br><br>Wrinkle ridges are linear to arcuate positive relief features and are often characterized by a broad arch topped with a crenulated ridge. These features have been identified on many bodies such as the Moon, Mercury, and Venus. On Mars, they are many tens-to- hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and have a relief of a few hundred meters. Wrinkle ridges are most commonly believed to form from horizontal compression or shortening of the crust due to faulting and are often found in volcanic plains.<br><br>Wrinkle ridges commonly have asymmetrical cross sectional profiles and an offset in elevation on either side of the ridge. The ridge in this image (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006494_1535_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>) appears to have a steeper southeast facing slope and a more gentle northwest facing slope. Some layering is also apparent in the ridge. Large dunes border the ridge to the north.<br><br>The reddish colors visible in the color image most likely indicate the presence of dust (or indurated dust). 
PSP_006500_2200	This image shows a set of intersecting faults in northern Utopia Planitia that expose materials buried beneath the surface. The area between each pair of faults has dropped below the surrounding surface, indicating that the crust fractured as it was pulled apart. Different generations of faults are visible by the cross-cutting relationships between the intersecting faults, and may indicate changes over time in the direction of the stress that caused the extension.<br><br>Several of the faults in this image expose a shallow, horizontal layer made up of <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006500_2200_cut_b.jpg'>dark rocks and boulders</a></strong> that is possibly volcanic in origin. A dark stain (<strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006500_2200_cut_c.jpg'>blue in this enhanced color image</a></strong>) surrounds the layer, made up of fine grained materials such as sand or dust.<br><br>Elsewhere in the image, faint dark streaks issue from the layer as this fine material is removed by the wind. Erosion of layers such as this presents a possible source of basaltic sand that may supply dunes and ergs far away.
PSP_006504_1910	This observation shows part of the floor of a large impact crater in Arabia Terra. This crater formed in the distant past when a large asteroid or comet struck Mars, and has been heavily modified since formation. The crater was partially filled by sediments, forming the rock outcrops and layers visible in this image. <br><br>After this material was laid down, part of the deposits were eroded away. The central part of the image has been carved especially deeply, forming a distinct depression. <br><br>This depression has been a site of aeolian (wind) transport of sand in more recent times. A particularly interesting aspect of this site is that there appears to have been multiple styles of aeolian activity. Both large sand dunes (the dark hills, <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006500_006599/PSP_006504_1910/PSP_006504_1910_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'>deep blue in the color image</a>) and smaller ripples (sharp, light-toned narrow ridges) are visible. While ripples are often found in association with dunes, the different colors suggest that the material is not the same. (At full resolution, the surfaces of both the dunes and the large ripples are covered with much smaller ripples.) <br><br>Even where the ripples and dunes are in contact, there is a distinct contrast between the materials. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006504_1910_cut_b.jpg'>In the subimage</a>, dark sand appears to fill a trough between two large light ripples, suggesting that the dark sand has moved more recently. This could be due to different grain sizes, since certain sizes are most easily lifted by the wind. 
PSP_006528_1120	Sand dunes are among the most prominent wind-formed features found on Mars. Their morphologies depend on the winds and also on the local supply of sand grains, so they provide clues to the nature of both the Martian atmosphere and surface.<br><br>Dunes form through the accumulation of coarse sand grains carried by the wind by means of saltation, or bouncing along the surface. Monitoring the present day dune activity can help determine the timescale over which Martian rocks are eroded, as the impacting grains sandblast the surface over time. The sands of Mars must be continually replenished as the coarse grains are ground into fine dust by repeated impacts. Finding the hidden sources of fresh sand is a challenge for HiRISE. <br><br>This image was targeted at a point in Mitchell Crater in the southern highlands of Mars where sands abruptly appear and spread north. The sands seem to derive from the edge of an eroding mesa (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006528_1120_cut_a.jpg'>shown here with an arrow</a>; 8.66 kilometer, or 5.4 miles across). A close-up view of the terrain nearby suggests that boulders and sand have been excavated by erosion from beneath brighter, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006528_1120_cut_b.jpg'>polygonally fractured ground</a> (1.45 km, or 0.9 mi across). <br><br>This rocky layer may originally have been a lava flow; Martian lava flows are predominantly composed of basalt, which would account for the dark color of the sand. The polygonal pattern of the bright upper layer may be due to repeated freezing and thawing of the soil that buries the lava flow. The tracks of dust-devils are clearly visible on the smooth, sandy surface but largely vanish when they cross into the polygonally fractured terrain.
PSP_006538_1035	This image gives a rare glimpse of an area in the far south of Mars that is frequently obscured by clouds or covered by surface frosts.<br><br>Crescent-shaped sand dunes <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006538_1035_cut_b.jpg'>can be seen scattered</a> across patterned ground. The surface patterns are made up of channels carved by carbon dioxide gas as it <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006538_1035_cut_c.jpg'>escapes from under</a> the seasonal frost. The dunes were still partially frozen when this picture was taken during the vernal equinox, as the Sun moved into the northern hemisphere at the end of the southern summer. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006538_1035_cut_d.jpg'>Bluish ice</a> is visible on the steep faces of the dunes and along their bases.<br><br>Typical sand dunes on Earth and Mars gradually move downwind as sand accumulates on the upwind (convex) side and then avalanches down the steeper down-wind side, called the ìslip faceî. Here, the sand motion appears to be around the dunes instead. Clean patches of ground <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006538_1035_cut_e.jpg'>downwind of the dunes</a> show that the surface is sheltered by the dunes, which prevent dark sand from being deposited in their lees.<br><br>
PSP_006561_2485	This high latitude image shows a portion of the landing ellipse for the Mars Scout spacecraft <a href='http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/'>Phoenix</a> as seen during late winter on Mars. Phoenix will land somewhere within the ellipse on Memorial Day, 2008, but probably not within this image.<br><br>While the Phoenix lander will land in mid-spring and operate through the Martian summer, the current winter landscape looks somewhat different. The Sun is beginning to rise from the winter night and is only 10 degrees above the horizon to illuminate the surface in this image. As a result, what few rocks are present cast noticeable shadows, and every bump and undulation of the surface, now matter how small, is accentuated.  <br><br>In this winter image, a blanket of carbon dioxide frost (dry ice snow) about a foot deep covers the surface. Bright patches in the image are areas where the frost is relatively clean, while in darker areas over much of the image, the frost is either dirty with atmospheric dust or the frost is somewhat translucent allowing us to see a little of the soil surface.<br><br>Summertime images of this region show that small hexagonal and polygonal patterns a few meters (yards) in size ubiquitously cover the entire region. These patterns are the result of annual thermal contraction in ice-cemented soil forming a honeycomb network of small fractures below the surface that manifest themselves as small shallow troughs at the surface. Interestingly, these patterns are not visible in this image. The shallow troughs that mark the polygons are currently filled in with carbon dioxide frost making them virtually invisible. As spring approaches the carbon dioxide frost will slowly sublimate (changes directly from ice to gas) and the polygons will once again become visible.
PSP_006567_2220	Two distinctly different terrain types are visible in this image of the northern lowlands of Mars. <br><br>An older, heavily cratered landscape has been inundated <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006567_2220_cut_a.jpg'>by much younger flows</a>. The valley floors are filled with flows that have relatively smooth surfaces and very few superposed impact craters.<br><br>In contrast, the mesas and hills making up the older terrain have blocky surfaces, perhaps fragmented by ancient impacts. The smooth surfaces of the flows are punctuated by <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006567_2200_cut_b.jpg'>curved, subparallel fractures</a> oriented transverse to the flow direction. These cracks resemble crevasses in terrestrial glaciers and were formed when the brittle solid crust of the flow fractured as it was dragged downstream. Detailed images such as this will help determine the role ice may have played in these flows.
PSP_006569_1915	Named after a 19th century French astronomer, Henry Crater is a 165 kilometer (103 mile) diameter impact crater, located in Arabia Terra on a portion of the Martian highlands extending into the northern hemisphere. This observation shows multiple layers on the edge of a mound on the floor of the crater, which is distinct from others in the immediate vicinity.<br><br>The layers represent the eroded remains of sedimentary rocks that formed from sediments deposited within the crater sometime after its formation. The origin of the sediments on the crater floor in not known but may be windblown dust and sand. The layers exhibit differences in degrees of hardness and resistance to erosion with resistant layers forming cliffs and more easily eroded layers forming ledges.<br><br>Several dark streaks are visible on slopes (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006569_1915_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. Streaks are believed to form by downslope movement of dust in an almost fluid-like manner (analogous to a terrestrial snow avalanche) either exposing darker underlying material or creating a darker surface by increasing its roughness.
PSP_006573_1560	This observation shows a wrinkle ridge in Solis Planum, located in the Thaumasia region of Mars, a high-elevation volcanic plain located south of the Valles Marineris canyon system and east of the Tharsis volcanic complex. Solis Planum contains some of the most distinct and well studied arrays of wrinkle ridges on Mars.<br><br>Wrinkle ridges are long, winding topographic highs and are often characterized by a broad arch topped with a crenulated ridge. These features have been identified on many other planetary bodies such as the Moon, Mercury, and Venus. On Mars, they are many tens to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and have a relief of a few hundred meters. Wrinkle ridges are most commonly believed to form from horizontal compression or shortening of the crust due to faulting and are often located in volcanic plains. They commonly have asymmetrical cross sectional profiles and an offset in elevation on either side of the ridge. Large dunes are also visible bordering the wrinkle ridge.<br><br>The reddish colors seen in this image most likely indicate the presence of dust (or indurated dust) and the darker, bluish colors most likely indicate the presence of larger rocks and boulders on the wrinkle ridge.<br>
PSP_006588_1615	This image captures the western side of a relatively young ìrampartî crater in the Tharsis region.<br><br>Rampart craters are surrounded by a fluidized ejecta blanket (an ejecta blanket is the material thrown out around a crater when the impact occurs, in this case resembling the whites of a fried egg, where the crater is the yolk). Researchers speculate that these may form when an object impacts ground that contains fluid (liquid or frozen) that is released upon impact.  <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'>THEMIS</a> images <a href='http://themis-data.asu.edu/img/browse/V06896002?band=1&stretch=S2'>V06896002</a> and <a href='http://themis-data.asu.edu/img/browse/V10266002?band=1&stretch=S2'>V10266002</a> provide context images for this side of the crater and show the rampart of the crater.<br><br>Within the crater <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006588_1615_cut_b.jpg'>we see evidence of landslides</a> originating at the upper edges. These landslides have exposed individual rock layers as well as outcrops of stronger rock types which are more resistant to erosion.
PSP_006609_1330	This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006609_1330_cut_a.jpg'>subimage</a> shows in detail dunes in the floor of Kaiser Crater, a large impact structure located in the Southern Highlands. It is approximately 200 kilometers (125 miles) in diameter and more than 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) deep.<br><br>The color subset shows a group of north-south trending longitudinal dunes that become sinuous towards the east. The crests of these dunes can be followed along many hundreds of meters. A second set of smaller longitudinal dunes is also apparent in the image; they are on the order of 70 m (230 feet) long and run approximately perpendicular to the first set. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006609_1330_cut_b.jpg'><strong>A look at the location</strong></a> shows that all these longitudinal dunes are, themselves, on the lee (upwind) side of a larger dune, almost 1,000 m (1,100 yards) long. <br><br>Dunes form when loose sand-sized materials are transported and deposited by a moving fluid, in this case wind. The present atmosphere of Mars is more than 100 times thinner than that of Earth. As a consequence, it is much more difficult for wind to move sand particles on Mars than it is on Earth. The dunes at Kaiser Crater must have formed under winds much stronger than those responsible for building similar dunes on our planet. Alternatively, they may have formed during a time when the Martian atmosphere was thicker.
PSP_006610_2035	Mawrth Vallis contains clay minerals that formed by chemical alteration of rocks by water. It is one of the short list of potential sites that the Mars Science Laboratory rover will land at, and the HiRISE team is working to find a safe place to land in this area.  <br><br>This observation shows a wide variety of scientifically interesting terrains as well as some potential hazards for landing. The central part of the image is dominated by light-toned materials with curving fractures of many different sizes. These fractures do not have a preferred orientation, indicating that they did not form in response to some regional stress pattern.<br><br>Instead, they formed by some more uniform process, possibly the drying of a thick mud deposit or the gradual rebound of the area as the overlying material was eroded away.  The scattered mounds and sand dunes may or may not prove to be a danger, but it is reassuring to see that many of the impact craters have been smoothed out with a filling of wind-blown sand.  
PSP_006625_1405	The Bosporos Montes make up part of the rim of the giant Argyre impact basin on Mars.  The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM)</a> identified this as a location with clay minerals. Such minerals contain water and may have formed under conditions favorable for life.  <br><br>This HiRISE image was taken to support the CRISM Team&rsquo;s investigation of this area.  While HiRISE does not have the ability to identify minerals the way CRISM can, the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006600_006699/PSP_006625_1405/PSP_006625_1405_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'>enhanced colors</a> in this image are similar to those seen in other clay-containing parts of Mars.<br><br>The light-toned mesas and plains are crisscrossed with small fractures that could have formed as a muddy clay deposit dried. However, this material is strong enough to form boulders where it has been hit by impact craters.
PSP_006633_2010	The Nili Fossae are valleys that have cut into the ancient crust of Mars, exposing clay minerals. These minerals formed in the presence of water and may be the result of chemical reactions between hot water and rocks. If so, this could have been a favorable location for Martian life in ancient times.  <br><br>This HiRISE image is part of a series in search for a safe place the Mars Science Laboratory rover can land. In the central part of the image, the terrain is a mix of sand dunes and relatively smooth rock exposures. There are some small knobs but very few large rocks in the area. Instead, the multi-colored rock exposures seem to be mostly a mosaic of flat fractured rock. <br><br>On the southern edge of the image, an impact crater is a potential hazard. In the northern part of the image, the scarp marking the boundary of the valley is visible.
PSP_006648_1300	Seen here is the eastern edge of a dune field in a large, degraded crater in the southern hemisphere. Similar to other dunes on Mars, these dunes are dark-toned and contain gullies.  <br><br>Gullies are features found on slopes and dunes in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres. Both slope and dune gullies were initially suggested to be a result of liquid water from the surface or subsurface. Slope and dune gullies usually have different morphologies: dune gullies are more linear and have levees bordering their channels. They typically have no distinguishable, or very small, alcove and debris aprons. Slope gullies, on the other hand, often have deeply incised alcoves and channels that exhibit fluvial characteristics such as streamlined islands.<br><br>What is highly unusual about this dune field is that one of its gullies <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006648_1300_cut_b.jpg'>has the morphology of a slope gully</a> (approximately 3 kilometers across)! This dune gully has a very incised alcove, what appears to be streamlined islands on the channel floor, and a large, feathery debris apron.
PSP_006648_2255	This image shows scarps (steep slopes) in Deuteronilus Mensae, a region of distinctive terrain in the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Polygonal fractures, possibly formed by thermal cycles in ice-rich ground, are visible throughout the scene. The high-standing topography at the top of the scarps have several muted circles. These are remnant impact craters that have degraded throughout time.  Their degradation process might have been enhanced by the presence of ground ice.  <br><br>The two scarps have different morphologies. The right (east-facing) side has a debris apron with a wave-like texture at its base. This is suggestive of material that has moved down the scrap and gradually flowed away from it. Such a process would be expected if the material were ice-rich. There is no counterpart of this feature at the base of the left (west-facing) cliff side.
PSP_006649_1615	The <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'>THEMIS </a> instrument onboard the Mars Odyssey spacecraft identified a possible salt deposit in this area, based on the infrared colors of the ground. Salt deposits typically form when water evaporates, suggesting that this might have once been an area favorable for life on Mars.  <br><br>The possible salt deposit is the slightly lighter-colored area in the center of the image.  The light-colored material is found peeking out from underneath sand dunes between small ridges and knobs of more tan colored material in the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006600_006699/PSP_006649_1615/PSP_006649_1615_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'>enhanced color data.</a> This suggests that the (possibly) salty layer was buried by other materials and then exposed by erosion.<br><br>This layer also exhibits a fracture pattern similar to clay-rich materials visible elsewhere on Mars. It is interesting that this layer is also relatively devoid of boulders, suggesting that it is made up of some weak material.
PSP_006653_1795	This image shows an equatorial volcanic vent. A volcanic vent is an opening in the crust of a planet that emits lava (molten rock) and volcanic gases. The rough texture of the plains surrounding the vent is indicative of lava.<br><br>There is a large number of snake-like features emanating from the vent. The parallel lines that outline the features are levees, which mark the edges of channels that carried molten lava. As lava flows, it moves slowest at its edges and bottom because the lava sticks to the non-flowing rocks, and as the lava slows, it cools off and hardens.<br><br>Levees form when the sides harden but the center of the flow keeps moving. As the eruption episode ends, and the lava drains, the center is left lower than the sides producing these high-standing structures.
PSP_006659_1460	Gullies on the northwest side of Dao Vallis, a Martian outflow channel, are the focus of this observation. The outflow channels are thought to have been carved by gigantic, ancient floods.  <br><br>Gullies are largely thought to be the result of water flow, but the origin of the water is much debated. One theory proposes that melting snowpack, or a mantling (blanketing) unit, forms gullies. Such a mantling unit is visible here between some of the gullies, in the full high-resolution image. Some alcove-shaped features appear to have mantling material in them. If the mantling unit is indeed related to gully formation, then gullies are potentially forming here.
PSP_006661_2185	This image shows fretted terrain in a northern hemisphere trough. Fretted terrain is the jumbled, lineated material filling the trough. The lineations (lines) mark movement of material, usually away from trough walls.<br><br>Much of the material filling the trough has a pitted texture. This likely formed from sublimation, when ice goes directly to a gas. When subsurface ice sublimates, it leaves a hole beneath the surface. The overlying material collapses and fills this hole, causing a pit to form. <br><br>The terrain outside the trough is covered in craters and muted circles. The muted circles are craters that have relaxed over time. As time goes on, the craterís topography becomes more subdued. Relaxation in this region is thought to occur because of the presence of ground ice.<br><br>In the center of the trough is a fresh crater; we call it ìfreshî because of its very steep walls. The big rocks in and around the crater are ejecta, material that was thrown out when the impact occurred, some of which has rolled back inside. The color image shows that one of the walls is much bluer than its surroundings. This might be from smaller particles blown into the crater by the wind.
PSP_006667_2150	Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the Solar System and is thought to have been active in the relatively recent past (which on Mars means many millions of years ago).  While this towering giant gets a lot of the attention, it is surrounded by a vast field of other volcanic features. This HiRISE image takes a close look at one set of intriguing landforms: small cones.  <br><br>Cones similar to these are found atop the freshest lava flows on Mars in Athabasca Valles. In that location, HiRISE found proof that they formed by steam exploding through the lava flow. The steam was produced by boiling water (or ice) in the ground underneath the lava flow. Could the same thing have happened here?  <br><br>Unfortunately, HiRISE finds that this area north of Olympus Mons is covered in a thick layer of dust. While the wonderful resolution of HiRISE reveals details of the ripples in the dust, it cannot show us what is underneath the dust. Therefore we cannot prove that these cones formed the same was as the Athabasca Valles cones. They could be small volcanic vents, but it is unlikely that so many small eruptions would have taken place so close together.<br><br>However, since we cannot show that the ground under the dust is lava, we cannot rule out non-volcanic processes. Still, the similarity in the shapes and sizes of these cones to the ones in Athabasca Valles leaves open the possibility that water and lava interacted explosively here.  <br>
PSP_006672_1420	The Hellas Montes are a group of mountains along the western rim of the giant Hellas Basin on Mars. <br><br>The Hellas Basin is the largest of the obvious impact craters on the Red Planet. It is very ancient and has been partially filled by sediments. The Hellas Montes are part of the eroded crater rim.  <br><br>In the central part of this HiRISE image, we can see steep slopes where landslides have exposed a variety of rocks. The jumble of blocks, rather than stacks of layered sediments or lavas, is consistent with impact crater ejecta. On flatter slopes, the ground is covered with a mantling deposit that is generally considered to be ice-rich dust.<br><br>In the southern part of the image, a large circular depression&mdash;rimmed by a zone with many large boulders&mdash;is visible. This is an impact crater with a relatively thin mantling deposit on its rim.<br><br>
PSP_006673_1600	This image shows part of a crater wall and floor, where the floor is covered by dunes and distinct regions of bright material. The bright material stands higher than the rest of the floor suggesting that it is more resistant to erosion than surrounding materials.<br><br>It is possible that more and more bright material will be exposed over time; why the material is bright is unknown. The material might be evaporites, that form when salt water dries up and leaves behind salt deposits (the evaporites).<br><br>Also in this scene is a crater with a ridge running up to its west (left) side. The ridge is lighter and might be evidence that water flowed through it, bleaching the rocks as it went. The water might have cemented the soil, causing it to be more resistant to erosion and high standing as seen today.
PSP_006676_2045	Mawrth Vallis has a rich mineral diversity, including clay minerals that formed by the chemical alteration of rocks or loose ìregolithî (soil) by water. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> on the MRO spacecraft detects a variety of clay minerals here, which could signify different processes of formation. The high resolution of the HiRISE camera helps us to see and trace out layers, polygonal fractures, and with CRISM, examine the distribution of various minerals across the surface. <br><br>This surface is scientifically compelling for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) rover, although some of the terrain can be somewhat rough. Scientists use HiRISE images to find the safest possible landing site for the rover. <br><br>This is one of four candidate landing sites in the Mawrth Vallis region.  <br>
PSP_006677_1475	This image contains streamlined features located northwest of Hale Crater, a 120 x 150 kilometer diameter impact crater that is possibly the youngest of its size on Mars.<br><br>A streamlined feature is one that is raised, possessing sharp edges. It is narrower at the downstream end because of the flow that carved it. Any fluid&mdash;lava, water, mud, and even flowing ice&mdash;can form streamlined features. Many portions of the image are filled with craters, while others are rather smooth.<br><br>The streamlined features in this image tend to be smoother, suggesting they are relatively young. Their origin might be related to the impact that formed the crater.
PSP_006679_1680	Layering is visible along the floor of a trough in Noctis Labyrinthis. The troughs in this area appear to be collapse pits and faults that extend across western Valles Marineris, the largest canyon system in the Solar System. Upwelling of the Tharsis Plateau causing extension in this region, and along with water drainage may explain the trough formation. <br><br>Layering is commonly seen along the upper walls of these troughs but in some cases, like this HiRISE image, layering is also visible along the floors of the trough. The layering along the floor could either represent rocks deposited before the trough formed that only became exposed by the removal of overlying material, or the layered material was deposited inside the trough after it already existed. Volcanism and aeolian activity could have deposited the layers, although water activity cannot be ruled out, especially if the layers formed before the trough exposed them.<br><br>Thicker layered deposits also exist within the larger troughs of Valles Marineris and their origins are also being explored and debated. 
PSP_006681_1580	This image features a very fresh crater in the southern hemisphere. The crater is termed fresh because it is well-preserved with steep walls and obvious small-scale ejecta.<br><br>The crater has a set of dark rays extending from it; these rays are ejecta that sprayed out when the crater formed. Boulders ejected during the impact surround the crater.
PSP_006690_2280	This image covers the eastern part of an unnamed crater located in the northern lowlands, showing features such as gullies, arcuate (bow-like) ridges, and scalloped terrain, that may indicate the presence of ice-rich materials near the surface. <br><br>As the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru_ctx.html'>CTX</a> context <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006690_2280_cut_a.jpg'>subimage</a> shows, the crater has gullies in its northern half (equator-facing slopes); no gullies are apparent in the southern half (pole-facing slopes). This observation is in agreement with theories proposing that some Martian gullies could form by melting of an ice rich-mantle deposited under different climatic conditions. Such ice-rich materials would be especially unstable in equator-facing slopes, where they would be exposed to maximum insolation (solar illumination).<br><br>The HiRISE image also shows arcuate ridges where the craterís slopes meet the floor. These ridges are 10-to-30 meter (30-to-100 feet) wide and can be followed for hundreds of meters (yards). They are similar to terrestrial features produced by mass wasting of ice-rich materials.<br><br>This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006690_2280_cut_b.jpg'>HiRISE subimage</a> (358 x 266 m or 392 x 291 yards) shows incipient scalloped terrain in the southern slopes of the crater. Scalloped terrain&mdash;depressions with scalloped edges and polygonal fractures&mdash;has been interpreted as a sign of surface caving, perhaps due to sublimation (evaporation) of underlying ice.
PSP_006695_1415	This image shows parts of Sirenum Fossae that are southwest of Gorgonum Chaos. Some of the troughs (fossae) have gullies on their walls. Gullies are incised slope features that are thought to have formed by liquid water flowing down the slopes.<br><br>It is unknown whether the water came from the subsurface or above the surface. The plains around the troughs have a number of mesas and hills that might have formed from erosion of a once-larger rock unit. The bottom of the image shows some dark linear features which are dust devil tracks.<br>
PSP_006703_1875	This observation shows an impact crater located east of Mojave Crater, with potential evidence of impact-induced rainfall. <br><br>This crater has a number of terraces, large portions of material that slumped off the crater wall probably during the late stages of formation. The floor itself is covered with material that likely was transported there during this time period. Around the mounds, the floor has a texture that is suggestive of flow; for example, there are places where the floor appears to lap up against some of the mounds.<br><br>In addition to the interesting crater floor mounds and texture, there are also <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006700_006799/PSP_006703_1875/PSP_006703_1875_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>dunes on the crater floor</strong></a> and streaks of unknown origin visible around the crater wall.
PSP_006714_2255	This image shows a possible landslide deposit originating from a mesa just east (right) of the center of the scene in Deuteronilus Mensae.<br><br>The deposit is the lobe-shaped feature extending across the center of the image. Located at approximately 45 degrees north, where ground ice is thought to be stable, it is possible that the deposit formed from mass wasting of ice-rich material. <strong><a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'>Mass wasting</a></strong> is a process driven by gravity that moves material downslope; ice enhances the process.<br><br>The lobe has distinct textures. It is bouldery at some locations (especially the left side) and pitted or wrinkled at others (especially at right). The pitted texture may be due to desiccation (drying) of soil that can occur when ice from beneath the surface sublimates (going directly from a solid to a gas) and leaves empty spaces into which the surface collapses.
PSP_006724_2165	Seen here are gullies in a northern hemisphere crater. The crater is well-preserved as indicated by its sharp rim and steep walls. Gullies are rarer in the northern hemisphere, possibly because there are fewer slopes for them to form on compared to the heavily cratered southern highlands.<br><br>This image captures a range of gully morphologies. The gullies on the north wall (south facing) are more abundant and evenly-spaced than those on the east and south walls, and they extend up to the crater rim on the northern side. These differences might occur because of differences in sunlight exposure and temperature variations.<br><br>The crater floor has a linear texture suggestive of flow. Ice-rich material might have moved off the crater walls, driven by gravity, and flowed towards the crater center.
PSP_006726_1830	Schroeter Crater is an approximately 300 kilometer (185 mile) diameter crater near the equator that is highly degraded. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006700_006799/PSP_006726_1830/PSP_006726_1830_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>The full image</strong></a> shows part of the west floor of the crater. <br><br>The floor is speckled with other craters, most of which are degraded; the largest entire crater in the scene (image above) has a sharp rim, indicating that it is relatively young. Although this crater is younger than most in the scene, it is filled with dunes, which tells us that it has been there long enough for the wind to blow material into it. <br><br>The bottom of the image covers the northeast rim of another crater. This crater looks like it was completely filled with material at one time and that this material has since been removed and sculpted by the wind. It contains dark dunes and piles of dark material, probably sand.
PSP_006734_1180	This image was taken in support of imaging by the <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/index.html'>Context (CTX)</a> camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and is an example of how the different instruments cooperate. Trumpler Crater is in the far southern part of the Martian highlands.  <br><br>This HiRISE image shows a frozen terrain typical at these latitudes. The surface is mantled by a deposit that is postulated to be largely a mix of dust and ice. However, many of the higher hills have had this mantle removed and the older rocks are exposed.  In some parts of Mars there is good evidence for ice having flowed from higher to lower ground, but there is no such evidence here. Perhaps the mantling deposit never formed on the tops of these hills or it was preferentially removed from these places.<br><br>In the flatter locations, the mantling deposit is completely covered by small cracks that form a polygonal network. These are clearest in the southern part of the image, where the sun is almost parallel to the surface, producing dramatic shadows. Such polygons are a common feature in permafrost. <br>
PSP_006736_1325	This image shows the intersection of two overlapping craters, although it is unknown which of the two formed first.<br><br>The two craters are covered in a mantling material, which gives them a smooth appearance. The mantling unit is thought to be water ice-rich. Concentric circles are visible on the floor of one crater. It is likely that these circles are evidence of ice-rich material that flowed off the crater wall, driven by gravity, onto the crater floor.<br><br>Outside of the craters, the plains have a pitted or dissected texture. Both of these textures are suggestive of material that once held ice that has since disappeared allowing the remaining soil to collapse into the subsurface. There are also dark dust devil tracks across the scene.
PSP_006742_2050	Mawrth Vallis is one of the most colorful parts of Mars. However, it is not quite as colorful as seen in this observation, where this ìextraî color comes from the fact that  HiRISE can ìseeî into part of the infrared, enhancing its ability to detect color differences that are indicative of various minerals.<br><br>Properly identifying those minerals is where the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>CRISM instrument</a> excels. They show that this area has a variety of different types of clay minerals: these are especially interesting because they had to form when water was interacting with rocks. The different types of clays point to different water chemistries and temperatures.<br><br>With HiRISE, we can better pinpoint how these different materials are distributed across the surface. Furthermore, by taking two images we can produce a stereo image and see the topography, allowing the different clay-bearing layers to be traced in three dimensions.
PSP_006745_1715	This scene is the floor of a trough in Noctis Labryinthus, a region of chaotic terrain located between the Tharsis Rise and Valles Marineris.<br><br>Its eastern extent leads into the start of Valles Marineris, a canyon that is about as wide as the continental United States. The trough has a depression which contains dunes and exposed layers. It is possible that the wind is sculpting out the depression and revealing the layers or it could be continued cracking and pulling apart of the ground. <br><br>These layers might be the same as those seen in the canyons of Valles Marineris; their origin is currently unresolved.
PSP_006745_2250	This image shows a central swath of a well preserved crater on the volcano Alba Patera. The crater has steep walls and no large superposed craters.<br><br>The mounds of material located adjacent to the walls probably fell there during the late-stages of crater formation. The center of the crater contains a central pit that has potential <a href='science_themes/fluvial.php'><strong>fluvial features</strong></a> that might have formed from water released in the impact melt.<br><br>There are abundant coalesced pits near the central depression. These also might have formed from volatiles escaping from impact melt.
PSP_006752_1525	Terby Crater was suggested as a possible landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory rover mission. It is a large crater blasted into the northern rim of the gargantuan Hellas Basin. Both of these holes in the crust of Mars were formed by impacts with asteroids or comets early in the planetís geologic history.<br><br>Large impacts excavate material from deep within the crust, allowing a rover to access rocks that otherwise would require a massive drilling rig. Since the interior of Mars is warm enough for liquid water, these rocks are of great interest in the search for possible ancient life on the Red Planet.  <br><br>As this HiRISE image shows, Terby Crater is interesting for additional reasons. The curving ridges most prominent near the center of the image look like stream channels.  However, unlike normal channels, the interior is higher than the surroundings. One way features like this form on Earth is called ìtopographic inversion.î Stream beds can become lined with larger gravels or cobbles, making them quite resistant to erosion, so with time, the surroundings are removed and the originally low channel is left standing high (and dry). <br><br>Another way similar features form is when a stream is flowing underneath a glacier. In this case the liquid water is confined by ice on either side and the sediments can build up. When the ice is removed, a ridge of these sediments is left behind. These are called ìeskersî by geologists. While further examination of this and similar HiRISE images may be able to distinguish between these possibilities, a rover would allow more detailed studies.  <br>
PSP_006754_1790	This image shows several colorful outcrops of rock in Schiaparelli, a large impact crater near Mars' equator. The colors indicate different rock layers and wind-blown materials, and a varied and complex geologic history. The area of the image is now being eroded, exposing several different types of material.<br><br>The <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006700_006799/PSP_006754_1790/PSP_ 006754_1790_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'>RGB false-color image</a> shows regions of several colors, corresponding to different textures. A prominent light-colored patch near the center of the image is one of the major rock types. This rock is eroding and has a scalloped appearance. Other rocks in this large light patch appear to have alternating light and dark layers. <br><br>Elsewhere in the image, the surface is blue and brown and has a ridged or rippled appearance, with several different scales of ripples. This material appears to sit on top of the light rocks near the center. These ridges have the appearance of ripples formed by wind-blown sand; strangely, however, some appear linked with ridges in the light outcrop at the center, so these could have been lithified (turned to rock). Observations like this one suggest that the relations between the units here are complex, since the units seem linked despite different colors and textures.
PSP_006760_1370	This image shows pole-facing gullies in a southern hemisphere crater. Gullies are young features that are widely thought to form from <a href='science_themes/fluvial.php'><strong>fluvial processes</strong></a> involving liquid water. These particular gullies have very fine channels, including some that intersect and overlap. This is evidence that multiple flow events occurred within the gullies.<br><br>The wavy, arcuate ridges at the bottom of the slope may have formed by gravity moving ice-rich material off the crater wall. The pitted texture of the crater floor suggests that volatiles (ices that easily turn into gas) escaped from the subsurface, causing the surrounding material to collapse and form small pits.
PSP_006769_1595	This image shows a portion of the southern highlands cut by Arda Valles, an ancient valley network.<br><br>The valley network is degraded as seen by the lack of obvious walls and a V-shaped bottom. The valley networks are thought to have formed by running liquid water on the surface of Mars billions of years ago, with a few being active more recently.<br><br>Arda Valles has many dunes within it and craters on top of it, which show that is has been around for long enough for craters to form. The surface that Arda Valles cuts is more cratered than the valley surface because wind has moved material into the valley throughout time such that the surface in the valley gets covered and past craters might be buried there.
PSP_006770_1760	This image shows raised ridges on a plain to the north of Juventae Chasma. Juventae Chasma, a canyon that is part of the Valles Marineris system, stretches for 180 kilometers (110 miles) east-west and 250 km (155 mi) north-south. Several examples of raised features have been identified on the plains near this canyon.<br><br>The raised ridges in this image (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006770_1760_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>) have been explained as former stream channels that  are now preserved in inverted relief. On Earth, inverted relief occurs when former depressions become elevated because materials that fill the depressions are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. For example, a depression may become filled with lava that is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding surface; gravel or boulders transported in a high energy flow protect underlying material from erosion, or sediments deposited by a flowing stream become cemented.<br><br>In this location, it is most likely that water, pure or salt water, once flowed through these channels and deposited sediments that eventually filled the channels and became cemented by some chemical precipitating from the flowing water. Over time, wind eroded the surrounding surface leaving the remnant channels exposed as raised ridges.
PSP_006773_1735	This image shows the eastern edge of a double crater near the equator. The featured crater overlaps a crater to the west (left). Not visible in the image, the ejecta of the craters end in ramparts, suggesting that ice was present when both craters formed.<br><br>Since the craters are so degradedóvisible in the image in the form of terraces and the muted crater rimóit is clear that they formed a long time ago.  <br><br>The scene is very dusty and abundant slope streaks are present. Slope streaks are thought to be small-scale dust avalanches that usually are dark when they form but fade into the background over time. <br><br><a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006700_006799/PSP_006773_1735/PSP_006773_1735_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>Near the top right of the image</strong></a> is a small cluster of craters that look to be about the same age. The cluster might have formed when a projectile from space or ejecta from another impact broke apart in the atmosphere before hitting the surface.  
PSP_006778_1995	This image covers an interesting area in the Nili Fossae region of Mars. The colorful mound on the western (left) side <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006778_1995_cut_b.jpg'><strong>of the highlighted portion</strong></a> appears to have been thrust up from beneath the dark plains to the east, and may be more resistant to erosion than the materials in the surrounding plains.<br><br>The colors in the mound likely correspond to minerals of diverse composition. A variety of igneous rocks as well as hydrated minerals have been identified in this area by orbiting near-infrared spectrometers. The bright band around the northeast margin of the mound is one of several distinct layers visible around its base.<br><br>Light-toned ripples or dunes are visible in low areas of the plains northeast of the mound and elsewhere throughout the image, including in two deep troughs cutting roughly north-south across the full image. These troughs, known as fossae, give the Nili Fossae region its name, and probably formed through tectonic activity relatively early in Martian history.
PSP_006806_2215	This image shows remnant raised margins and other interior structures of a lobate flow feature emanating the mouth of an alcove along a mesa in Deuteronilus Mensae.<br><br>This region of Mars has many features called ìlobate debris apronsî that spread out below the scarps of polygonal mesas. Many of the debris aprons have what appear to be lineations or grooves that are parallel to their movement direction indicating flow of the materials. The flow may be due to the presence of ice in the material. Recent data from the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru_sharad.html'><strong>Shallow Radar instrument (SHARAD)</strong></a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft has indicated a large reservoir of subsurface ice in the Deuteronilus Mensae region that supports the observational evidence of surface flow.<br>
PSP_006820_1760	This image shows part of the floor of a large crater in Arabia Terra, near Marsí equator. A notable feature on this crater floor is a region of dark patches up to about 100 meters (330 feet) across. These dark patches sit in an area of connected small ridges and spurs and bury them, filling in the low areas and piling up. In several places light ridge crests protrude through the dark material. <br><br>The dark patches appear to be collections of wind-blown sand. Sand on Mars is often dark, likely because it is fragments of a volcanic rock called basalt. (Sand on Earth is most often light-toned quartz). Sand may tend to collect in patches that can ultimately evolve into large dunes if more sand gathers. The patches of sand here are not big enough to form such large structures, but small-scale regular texture due to blowing wind is visible on the surface. <br><br>The relatively dark tone which can be seen around the sand patches (compared with the surrounding material) is probably due to small amounts of additional sand. In some places this collects at the bottom of troughs.
PSP_006835_1535	Alluvial fans are deposits of sand, gravel, and sometimes boulders that were eroded from steep slopes (mountain fronts or basin walls) and deposited on plains at the base of the slope. Erosion of deep alcoves into the walls of Holden Crater (155 kilometers in diameter) provided sediment to these alluvial fans, that have coalesced into a large deposit called a bajada.<br><br>Most Martian impact craters that contain large alluvial fans are clustered between 18 and 29 degrees south, and the Holden bajada is the largest of these deposits recognized to date. Inverted channels are located on the alluvial fans, where the old stream beds were more resistant to later wind erosion than the fine-grained sediment deposited outside the channels; preferential erosion left the channel beds exposed as ridges. Many ripples of more recent, wind-blown sand are found between the older inverted channels.<br><br>The<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) would land on the bajada and drive across the traversable ripples to the south, where the inverted channels, layers, and evidence for past fluvial activity are located.
PSP_006841_1935	This image covers the primary cavity of the distinctive rayed crater Dilly. Dilly is what is commonly referred to as a ìbutterflyî crater. This colloquial name refers to the asymmetry of the ejecta giving the appearance of ìwingsî around an elliptical cavity, and hence, the overall appearance of a butterfly. This asymmetry is captured quite nicely in the full-length HiRISE image (see the JP2 product options at the right).<br><br>The ìbutterflyî appearance and elliptical cavity of Dilly (approximately 2 x 2.3 kilometers in diameter) are distinctive clues indicating that the crater formed from a low-angle impact (< 45 degrees), likely from the southwest. <br><br>In addition to being a ìbutterflyî crater, Dilly is one of the smallest of the large rayed crater systems discovered in THEMIS nighttime infrared (temperature) images. Dilly, like its rayed counterparts such as Zunil, <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/features/gratteri'>Gratteri,</a> Tomini, Zumba, and the recently discovered unnamed crater seen in <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003611_1970'>PSP_003611_1970</a>, possesses distinctive rays (i.e., spoke-like and far-traversing radial ejecta features) that are most readily viewed in THEMIS images. Crater rays are distinctive in the infrared because they are comprised of both dust and coarse, rocky materials, which are contrasted as cold (dark) and warm (bright) respectively. Because rays are ephemeral features, they are noted by scientists as a tell-tale sign of a fresh or well-preserved crater.<br><br>In the image, we can also observe that Dilly possesses a very distinctive light-toned south-west-trending streak that indicates modification by wind. Light-toned dunes are also visible in the bottom of the crater. 
PSP_006855_1750	Gale Crater is a large (152 kilometer diameter) crater in the cratered highlands of Mars near the highland/lowland divide. The crater contains a large central mound of layered, or stratified, material that is more than 2 km thick in some places.<br><br>Visible in this image is a deep chasm cutting through these layers, which are spectacularly exposed in the chasm walls. On the floor of this chasm is a sinuous, positive-relief feature that may be an <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006855_1750_cut.jpg'><strong>inverted channel deposit</strong></a>. Inverted channels occur when sediment in a stream hardens and becomes cemented in place due to water-deposited minerals. After the flow ceased, later erosion removed the surrounding softer rock, leaving the cemented channel deposit as a positive rather than a negative relief feature. <br><br>This chasm may actually be classified as a canyon, which is specifically a chasm or gorge that was carved by running water.
PSP_006873_1800	This image shows a broad expanse of light-toned sediments in Terra Meridiani, near the Martian equator. Light deposits like this are common in many parts of Mars, and indicate a history of diverse geologic processes. <br><br>The rocks here are eroding in a variety of different textures and patterns, that may correspond to changes in factors like grain size and degree of cementation, or to entirely different types of rock. There is also a <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_006800_006899/PSP_006873_1800/PSP_006873_1800_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>substantial color diversity</strong></a> across the image. <br><br>Rocks like these have many possible origins. They could have been laid down in rivers or lakes, settled from the air as dust or volcanic ash, or deposited by desert sand dunes. Sand dune deposits are known to occur in this region of Mars at the landing site of the Opportunity rover, but the rocks exposed there are only part of a thick stack. Some of the rocks in this image may have been deposited in streams: the narrow ridges in the northern part of the image could be an old channel converted into a ridge. This has happened at other sites on Mars where stream beds are more resistant to erosion than their surroundings.
PSP_006887_2050	Mawrth Vallis has a rich mineral diversity, including clay minerals that formed by the chemical alteration of rocks or loose ìregolithî (soil) by water. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> on the MRO spacecraft detects a variety of clay minerals here, which could signify different processes of formation. The high resolution of the HiRISE camera helps us to see and trace out layers, polygonal fractures, and with CRISM, examine the distribution of various minerals across the surface. <br><br>This surface is scientifically compelling for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) rover, although some of the terrain can be somewhat rough. Scientists use HiRISE images to find the safest possible landing site for the rover.
PSP_006891_1970	Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the Solar System. While it is one of the youngest volcanoes on Mars, it has a complicated history. This image <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006891_1970_cut_b.jpg'>reveals new details</a> of the sequence of geologic events around its base.<br><br>At the top of the cutout, there is a large hill that is surrounded by lava flows from Olympus Mons. This hill is likely to be a chunk of the older part of the volcano that was moved here by a large land slide. The lava flows along the flank of Olympus Mons had most of the lava transported through channels. These channels are preserved where the lava drained out from between the stationary walls (called "levees," like along the sides of a contained river).<br><br>The bottom right part of the cutout has a much flatter and smoother surface. These are younger lava flows that have buried the lower part of the volcano. When lava flows form vast smooth sheets, they are called "flood" lavas.<br><br>In the bottom of the cutout, the flood lavas have odd, wiggly looking plateaus. These are parts of the lava crust that were lifted up when more liquid lava was injected into the middle of the slowly solidifying lava flow. This process is called "inflation" and is seen on many lava flows on Earth. These younger lava flows are cut by two different sets of faults.  One makes the branching valley in the flood lavas and the other creates the sinuous ridge and valley along the edge of the Olympus Mons lava flows. Lower resolution images that cover a broader area suggest that the sinuous fault is an old buried structure that has been more recently reactivated.
PSP_006913_1765	Miyamoto Crater is located in southwest Meridiani Planum (and southwest of the <a href='http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html'><strong>Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity</strong></a> landing site). This image shows fairly smooth plains and some areas covered by wind streaks, suggesting that wind is an active process here, depositing surface material downwind in the form of streaks.<br><br>This landing site is adjacent to the hematite-bearing plains unit where the Opportunity rover sits. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> has detected phyllosilicates (clay minerals) at this landing site, which scientists believe to have formed in the presence of water. The MSL rover would investigate the mineral diversity here, which includes phyllosilicates and sulfates.
PSP_006941_1825	This image shows a large symmetrical alluvial fan at the mouth of a small channel along an unnamed crater. Alluvial fans with a well-defined channel source area are relatively uncommon on Mars.<br><br>This fan has a rib-like outer margin and many more terrace-like scarps upslope near the channel mouth. These terraces may indicate the outer margin of sediment deposits during each ìpulseî of deposition. Further study of these types of alluvial fans may shed light on past sedimentary environments and conditions on Mars.
PSP_006952_1870	This image shows dunes in an unnamed crater in the west Arabia Terra region. The rim of the crater lies to the south of the image and a dark, toned field of barchan sand dunes rests on the crater floor in the northern portion of the observation. <br><br>Barchan dunes are commonly found on Earth, and are generally crescent-shaped with a steep slip face bordered by horns oriented in the downwind direction (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006952_1870_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). Barchan dunes form by unidirectional winds and are good indicators of the dominant wind direction. In this case, the strongest winds blew approximately north to south. <br><br>These dunes are most likely composed of basaltic sand that has collected on the bottom of the crater. Superimposed on their surface are smaller secondary dunes which are commonly seen on terrestrial dunes of this size (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006952_1870_cut_b.jpg'>see subimage</a>). Many smaller and brighter bed formsómost likely small dunes or granule ripplesóalso cover the substrate between the larger dark dunes. The dark dunes overlie the small bright bed forms indicating that the darker dunes formed more recently.
PSP_006962_1520	This image shows a broad expanse of rock in the southern highlands of Mars. This outcrop is located on the floor of a large, old impact crater, now partially filled in, and shows the nature of some of the infilling material. <br><br>At large scale, the outcrop shows a series of linear aligned ridges. These are yardangs, formed by aeolian (wind) erosion. As the wind erodes the rock, it shapes it into aerodynamic forms. At smaller scale, the wind has carved fine grooves and scallops into the rock surface, aligned in the same direction as the large yardangs. <br><br>At full resolution, the rock is heavily fractured. At many sites, the rock is breaking into angular boulders. The largest cracks appear to have developed into shallow troughs, since they are weak sites which are most easily eroded. Troughs and other low areas have been filled by wind-blown sand or dust. <br><br>One possible source for this rock is volcanic ash. The outcrop lies between Hadriaca Patera and Tyrrhena Patera, two ancient volcanoes. These volcanoes appear different from the giant shield volcanoes like Olympus Mons; it has been suggested that they erupted more explosively, while the large shields were built mostly by lava flows.
PSP_006968_1735	This image shows the northern portion of east Candor Chasma, part of the Valles Marineris canyon system. In the center of the image is a light-toned mound that has dozens of layers exposed along its edge. As the upper layers weather and break apart into smaller grains, these grains subsequently fall down the edge, burying layers beneath and producing triangular-shaped debris aprons. <br><br>The color image of the mound doesnít show any significant color variations between the different layers. However, another instrument on MRO called CRISM (Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars) has observed compositional differences between the layers and these results have been helpful in deciphering the origin of these layers.<br><br>This deposit is one of several examples exhibiting sulfate-rich layers with alternating hydration states. Cliff-forming kieserite-rich layers alternate with slope-forming polyhydrated sulfate layers. (Kieserite is a mineral containing magnesium). The apparent lack of slumping, channels, cross-bedding or bed truncation supports quiescent water or deposition from the air as the most likely origin for the layers.
PSP_006969_1725	This image shows part of Noctis Labyrinthus, the ìLabyrinth of the Night.î This is a system of connecting troughs which form a maze-like network at the western end of Valles Marineris, the giant canyon system of Mars.<br><br>The individual troughs are usually kilometers across; this image shows part of the floor of one of the troughs, with some intriguing fine-scale features. <br><br>Near the center of the image, the floor is broken up into many small knobs and hills, probably eroded remnants of a larger geologic unit. The most striking feature of many of these knobs is a thin, bright band which often wraps around the edges near the bottom, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006969_1725_cut_b.jpg'><strong>as in the image cutout.</strong></a> This image was acquired in order to investigate whether this is an exposed layer of rock or the shoreline of a former body of water. <br><br>HiRISE resolves details of the bright band that indicate that this is an unusual layer of rock, rather than an old shoreline. In several places, the band is broken up along cracks, sometimes forming boulders. This indicates that the band is solid rock, while material left on a shoreline should be loose sediments. It is now exposed as rings and arcs where erosion has cut deeply enough to expose the layer.<br><br>This band must indicate some unusual event in the geologic history of the region when a different type of rock was deposited; it is strikingly different in color from the other rocks. Although it is not a shoreline, it could be material that was deposited on the floor of a much older lake or sea and then buried by other rock; it could also have been laid down by other sedimentary processes or as volcanic ash. 
PSP_006984_1840	This image shows distinctive differences in the texture of the ground surface in an area of Mars called Gordii Dorsum.<br><br>The upper right part of the image contains many subparallel ridges. These ridges are geological features called yardangs (long irregular ridges carved by wind erosion). The lower half of the image is smoother and contains a few small knobs and ridges. This area of Mars contains extensive outcroppings of layered sedimentary rocks that may have formed by the accumulation of sand and dust either blown in by the wind, transported by water, or some combination of processes such as these.<br><br>The distinctive surface textures may be due to differences in the rock structure and formation process. Mapping differences in the surface textures such as these may help to reveal how these rocks formed and advance our understanding of the geologic history of Mars.
PSP_006991_1905	Named after a 19th century French astronomer, Henry Crater is a 165 kilometer (103 mile) diameter impact crater, located in Arabia Terra on a portion of the Martian highlands extending into the northern hemisphere. The rim of the crater is in the western side of the image and the slope streaks pictured here extend eastward down the slopes of the crater wall into the crater.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_006991_1905_cut_b.jpg'><strong>The subimage is a close-up</strong></a> view of dark and light-toned slope streaks. The slope streaks generally start at a point source and widen downslope as a single streak or branch into multiple streaks. Some of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders, and a few appear to originate at boulders or clumps of rocky material. The darkest slope streaks are youngest and cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks. The lighter-toned streaks are believed to be dark streaks that are lightening with time as new dust is deposited on their surface.<br><br>Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars making slope streaks some of the youngest features on the Martian surface. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of slope streaks including dry avalanching, geochemical weathering, liquid stains or flows, and moisture wickering. Recent observations from HiRISE images have revealed that the dark interior of slope streaks is lower in elevation than the surroundings indicating that material must have been removed in the formation of the streak.
PSP_007004_2000	This image shows a fresh, 2 kilometer diameter crater on the floor of the much larger Pasteur Crater.<br><br>The enhanced HiRISE color creates a stunning mixture of gold and blue, which here is superficially remniscent of the <a href='http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photos/patterns-island-aerials/belize-blue-hole-reef.html'><strong>Great Blue Hole</strong></a> near Belize City.<br><br>Of course, this isn't water but sand that has collected. The question remains from where.
PSP_007006_1765	This image shows a large outcrop of layered rock in Aureum Chaos, an area that has apparently collapsed, leaving a region of irregular knobs and hills. Unlike many of the knobs, the light outcrop shows distinct, nearly horizontal layers. This may indicate that it was deposited after the collapse of the Chaos. <br><br>Multiple layers are exposed in the outcrop, which is several kilometers long. The best exposures, in the north wall, reveal multiple different rock units with different color and texture. The bottom unit is very light-toned and shows little internal structure other than occasional fractures. Above this is a darker unit with a broken appearance, followed by fine, stepped layers. The top of the outcrop consists of knobs and spires that may be eroded remnants of the top of the stack. Many of the units show variations in color which could indicate further divisions. <br><br>This package of rocks may have been deposited by multiple processes. Alternatively, the same process could have delivered sediments from different sources. Some possible origins include dust or volcanic ash settling from the atmosphere, wind-blown sand, or material deposited in lakes. <br>
PSP_007033_1445	Channels are found all around Hale Crater. The largest channels were there before the formation of Hale, such as Uzboi Vallis.<br><br>The impact that created Hale Crater smashed directly into Uzboi Vallis, a very large channel thought to have periodically transported hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of water per second. Another nearby channel is Nirgal Vallis, an approximately 700 kilometer (430 miles)-long channel interpreted to have formed from groundwater sapping. Nirgal Vallis is about 300 kilometers (190 miles) from Hale.<br><br>Other, smaller channels also radiate from Hale. The relationship between the channels and the ejecta from Hale Crater strongly suggests the Hale-forming impact event created, or at least heavily modified, the channels.<br><br>One of the types of channels thought to have been formed at the same time as Hale Crater is a channel with raised margins. These channels are relatively short (less than 5 kilometers, or 3 miles) and less than 0.5 kilometers (0.3 miles) wide. They are found on the slope break at the very edge of the northern rim of Argyre Basin, which opens to the bottom left of this image. We interpret these channels to be the result of debris flows.<br>
PSP_007043_2650	This image shows dunes near the north pole of Mars. The north pole is surrounded by a vast ‚Äúsea‚Äù of basaltic sand dunes, and the dunes imaged here are similar to barchan dunes that are commonly found in desert regions on Earth.<br><br>Barchan dunes are generally crescent-shaped with a steep slip face <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007043_2650_cut_b.jpg'><strong>bordered by horns oriented in the downwind direction</strong></a>. Barchan dunes form by winds blowing mainly in one direction and thus are good indicators of the dominant wind direction when the dunes formed. In this case, the strongest winds blew approximately south to north. <br><br>The dunes and surrounding surface appear bright because they are covered with seasonal frost left over from the northern hemisphere winter. Sunlight is now falling on the north polar region, and carbon dioxide frost that accumulated during winter is sublimating (going directly from solid to gas) and the surface beneath the frost is being revealed. Composed primarily of basaltic sand, the dunes will appear dark during the northern hemisphere summer. The dark spots are areas where some of this frost has begun to sublime away, and/or where wind has exposed the underlying dark sand.<br>
PSP_007055_2015	This image is located west of the Nili Fossae trough, one of the proposed landing sites for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a>. Here, we combine information from two other MRO instruments, the <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/'><strong>Context Camera</strong></a> (CTX) and the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars</strong></a> (CRISM), to provide insight into the geology of the region.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007055_2015_cut_a.jpg'><strong>The first subimage</strong></a> shows the CTX image, with the HiRISE footprint shown in yellow. This footprint covers dark and light terrain. Looking at the HiRISE image, the dark terrain is fairly featureless in some areas, whereas other parts, when zoomed in to high resolution, show ripples, sand deposits resulting from wind activity. The lighter terrain is bedrock.<br><br>Zooming in, this material commonly has a polygonal texture.  <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007055_2015_cut_b.jpg'><strong>The second subimage</strong></a> shows the HiRISE footprint with the location, shown as a red rectangle, of a color enhanced portion of the image; this color product <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007055_2015_cut_c.jpg'><strong>is visible here</strong></a>. It combines HiRISEís blue-green, red, and infrared filters and is enhanced to bring out detail.<br><br>By folding in data from CRISM, we can correlate the colors to materials and composition. The green and bluish colors represent a composition rich in mafic (iron- and magnesium-rich) minerals such as pyroxene and maybe olivine, with green having the greatest concentration. The green-blue material at the upper right is mostly rock, whereas the materials in the bedforms (at left) are composed of sand. The reddish materials are composed of magnesium- and iron-rich clays, possibly formed by ancient water that altered volcanic rock. In this scenario, the polygonal texture could represent cracks formed after the clays dried. CRISM also detects minor amounts of clay in the green and blue units.<br>
PSP_007059_1975	This image shows a cluster of impact craters in Chryse Planitia, near the outlet of one of Marsí giant outflow channels.<br><br>The craters are loosely aligned in a chain running from northwest to southeast. Clusters like this form when an asteroid or comet impacts the surface and forms a large crater; material thrown out of that crater often forms streaks or rays containing many small craters from the impact of ejected blocks. These secondary craters are sometimes more irregularly shaped since they are typically less energetic impacts; many of the craters in this image are not quite circular. <br><br>An interesting feature to note is the dark material in many of the larger craters. What accounts for this? The largest craters trap wind-blown sand most effectively, but many of the smaller, shallower craters also contain ripples suggesting that they also trap sand or dust.<br><br>An alternative possibility is that these craters have excavated to a deeper layer of different material. A combination of these processes is also possible, since smaller craters may be more easily buried.
PSP_007095_2020	This observation is centered within Antoniadi Crater. This crater, even prior to the MRO mission, was identified as a likely ancient lake  (now dry) that was supplied by both surface water and ground water.<br><br>The image provides further tantalizing evidence of a water-rich past. Most of the flat parts of the image have a polygonal texture, which commonly forms when mud dries. In the center of the image are branched (ìdendriticî) features that connect southward to a larger trunk-shaped landform; the branches resemble stream channels on Earth. Unlike active channels with water, these features are ìinverted,î or elevated above the surrounding terrain. Again, in analogy with such features seen on our planet, these probably formed when materials deposited by the streams, such as coarse gravel, or chemical cementation after removal of the water, caused the channel bottoms to become resistant. Over time, natural erosion from wind and other processes left the inverted channels elevated above the surrounding terrain.<br><br>The branched features are probably remnants of small tributary streams that fed the larger trunk-shaped stream. It appears that the inverted streams lie on top of, and are therefore younger, than the polygons. This area may have first had a lake that later dried to form the polygons, followed by episodes of stream flow and erosion.
PSP_007124_1765	Miyamoto Crater is located in southwest Meridiani Planum (and southwest of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landing site). This image shows fairly smooth plains and some areas covered by wind streaks. <br><br>The streaks suggest that wind is an active process here, depositing surface material downwind in this distinctive form.<br><br>This landing site is adjacent to the hematite-bearing plains unit where the Opportunity rover sits. The <strong><a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>CRISM</a></strong> instrument has detected phyllosilicates (clay minerals) at this landing site, which scientists believe to have formed in the presence of water.<br><br>The <strong><a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'>Mars Science Laboratory</a></strong> rover would investigate the mineral diversity here, which includes phyllosilicates and sulfate minerals.
PSP_007126_1210	This image shows a large gully in the wall of a crater in the southern hemisphere. Such gullies are among the most recent landforms on Mars, and were probably carved by liquid water.<br><br>The source of the water is still unknown; it could have been groundwater from a shallow aquifer or melted snow or ground ice from a different climate. <br><br>This gully is not particularly fresh, but it is among the largest observed; several sub-channels merge in the alcove on the upper slope, in the north part of the image. Numerous faint troughs and lineations are visible downslope, likely indicating old channels that have been buried or reworked. The upper alcove exposes a dense cluster of boulders not seen on the adjacent slope. This could indicate that smaller material has been removed by the gullies, exposing the boulders without transporting them far.
PSP_007140_2640	This observation is the ìbeforeî image of a avalanche caught in action; its companion image is <a href='PSP_007338_2640'> where you can see the îduringî and ìafterî images of this spectacular event.<br>
PSP_007143_1370	Several characteristics of crater wall gullies are visible in this image that provide possible insight into the formation mechanisms of gullies on Mars.<br><br>Gullies near the top (north) end of the image are deeper and originate in alcoves near the rim of the crater. Gullies near the middle of the image are shallow and contain a more complex array of small channels. These smaller gullies initiate from a uniform elevation within the crater wall rather than at the crater rim. This suggests that the materials which flow down the crater slopes to form the gullies originates at a specific layer exposed in the crater wall.<br><br>The undulating pattern of ridges on the crater floor (<a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_007100_007199/PSP_007143_1370/PSP_007143_1370_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>left side of the image</strong></a>) appear similar to features interpreted as  elsewhere on Mars that involve ice-rich materials. <br>
PSP_007151_1445	This image shows an unnamed, bowl-shaped impact crater located in the Southern Highlands. The crater is approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) in diameter and 600 meters (2,000 feet) deep.<br><br>The colors depicted in this image are not those we would see with our naked eyes. An infrared band and two visible bands (red and blue-green, respectively) have been combined to produce this <a href='http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/compositor/'>false-color </a> image. False color combinations are often utilized to look for subtle compositional differences that may not be evident in true color images.<br><br>This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007151_1445_cut_b.jpg'>subimage</a> (enhanced to exaggerate color contrast) shows part of the north-facing walls of the crater, deeply carved by landslides. Rocky layers, mostly purplish in color, can be followed for hundreds of meters, poking through the loose materials that cover the slopes. Locally, the rocky layers show patches of diverse colors (blue, green, yellow.) These colors may be indicative of compositional differences in the rocky layers.
PSP_007153_2505	Windblown sand can be used to tell us the wind direction on Mars. Small-scale features, such as ripples and wind tails, indicate the  most recent wind directions.<br><br>Wind tails may be the remnants of a formerly widespread mantle of sediment that has been removed. Alternatively, they may have formed when aeolian sediment is deposited in the wind-shadow zone behind obstacles such as the 1.5 meter diameter boulders <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007153_2505_cut_a.jpg'><strong>on the crater rim</strong></a>. Their orientation points in the downwind direction. In the figure, two wind tails extend from some boulders indicating winds from at least two directions.<br><br>Ripples occur on the surface of all dunes imaged at HiRISE resolution on Mars. The alignment of ripples often results from the influence of more than one wind direction. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007153_2505_cut_b.jpg'><strong>In this figure</strong></a>, the ripples are superimposed on a low dome dune. On Earth, ripples on the surface of sand dunes may re-orientate in a matter of hours. The time required to re-orientate ripples on Mars is unknown.<br>
PSP_007162_1915	This observation is of region between large craters in Arabia Terra, which is a large swath of bright (high albedo) terrain in the Martian cratered uplands.<br><br>At the center of this image is a channel with a sinuous, fluvial-like (river-like) morphology, although it has long since been dry. The floor of the channel is covered with an array of linear dunes, which are accumulations of windblown sediment.<br><br>Of special interest in this scene is a series of dark (low albedo) and brighter (higher albedo) discolorations along the channel walls, also known as slope streaks. Most slope streaks are initially dark, gradually brighten with time, and are thought to be due to dust avalanches that remove a thin layer of bright dust to reveal darker material. Here, many streaks appear brighter than the surrounding undisturbed slope surface, and the origin of these bright streaks is not entirely clear.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007162_1915_cut.jpg'><strong>In this subimage,</strong></a> it is apparent that dark streak always appear to be on top of the bright streaks, indicating that the dark streaks are younger.
PSP_007166_1740	Scanning across several kilometers of relief, this image shows a cliff along a light-toned layered deposit in Valles Marineris. This particular cliff was targeted because of the excellent exposure of layering and the identification of the minerals kieserite (a mineral containing magnesium) and hematite (an iron oxide).<br><br>The hematite appears in the darker low-lying region near the lower left of the image and the kieserite is associated with the light-toned layers. The fact that these minerals are found here with a layered deposit suggests that water may have been involved in the deposition of these minerals and the layers.<br><br>Erosion by wind has carved V-shaped patterns along the edges of many of the layers. The layers appear friable (easy to erode) so this is why wind can carve deep grooves along a steep cliff such as visible here. The top of the layered deposit (<a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_007100_007199/PSP_007166_1740/PSP_007166_1740_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>upper part of image</strong></a>) is smooth and relatively dark because it is covered by debris laid down by the wind, dust and other fine materials.<br><br>The cliff has stronger winds flowing up and down it, plus the effects of gravity, so airborne debris can be shed downslope to expose the fresh brighter layered deposit. 
PSP_007173_2245	This image shows a portion of the Utopia Planitia, marked by polygonal features bounded by cracks and depressions in the mantle that possess scalloped edges. <br><br>Scalloped pits are typical features of the Martian mid-latitude mantle. Their presence has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, possibly interstitial ice, by sublimation (ice going directly from the solid state to the gas state). Their formation most likely involves development of oval- to scalloped-shaped depressions that may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp and a gentler equator-facing slope. <br><br>On the surface surrounding the scalloped depressions is a polygonal pattern of fractures. This is commonly associated with scalloped terrain, and indicates that the surface has undergone stress, potentially caused by subsidence (sinking), desiccation (drying out), or thermal contraction. These polygon features are similar to permafrost polygons that form in polar and high alpine regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil. On Earth, such polygon features are indicative of the presence of ground ice. Several cracks cut through the side of the scallops suggesting that they must be at least <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007173_2245_cut_b.jpg'><strong>as deep as the scallops</strong></a>. The polygons may have been present previous to the erosion of the mantle.<br><br>The landforms we observe here most likely show that ice-rich permafrost is present or has been present geologically recently. At this latitude on Mars, the conditions of pressure and temperature allow water ice within the ground to sublime. The disappearance of the ice component of the ground probably leads to the formation of the depressions, a process that may still be active today.
PSP_007191_1535	Alluvial fans are deposits of sand, gravel, and sometimes boulders that were eroded from steep slopes (like mountain fronts or basin walls) and deposited on plains at the base of the slope. Erosion of deep alcoves into the walls of Holden Crater (155 kilometers/100 miles in diameter) provided sediment to these alluvial fans, which have coalesced into a large deposit called a bajada.<br><br>Most Martian impact craters that contain large alluvial fans are clustered between 18 and 29 degrees South, and the Holden bajada is the largest of these deposits recognized to date. Inverted channels are located on the alluvial fans, where the old stream beds were more resistant to later wind erosion than the fine-grained sediment deposited outside the channels. Preferential erosion left the channel beds exposed as ridges. Many ripples of more recent, wind-blown sand are found between the older inverted channels.<br><br>The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) would land on the bajada and drive across the traversable ripples to the south, where the inverted channels, layers, and evidence for past fluvial (water) activity are located.
PSP_007193_2640	In northern winter a seasonal polar cap composed of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) forms in the north polar region. This cap covers a vast sea of dunes at high northern latitudes. In the spring the ice sublimates (evaporates directly from ice to gas) and this active process loosens and moves tiny dust particles.<br><br>The <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007193_2640_cut_b.jpg'><strong>subimage shows a region of the dunes</strong></a> that are just beginning to lose their seasonal ice cover. In most of the image the dunes are a muted red color. Where the sun is shining on the steep dune crests the frost is gone and dark dust is free to cascade down the sides. This thin layer of dust, like slope streaks found elsewhere on Mars, flows down around obstacles and may come to rest mid-slope.
PSP_007207_2485	This image shows seasonal frost in the northern hemisphere plains of Mars, showing a portion of the landing ellipse for the Mars Scout spacecraft Phoenix. Phoenix will land somewhere within the ellipse on 25 May 2008 (Memorial Day in the United States.)<br><br>The bright surfaces in this image are <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007207_2485_cut_b.jpg'><strong>covered with seasonal carbon dioxide frost</strong></a> (dry ice snow). During the winter, the entire surface was covered with a blanket of carbon dioxide frost about a foot deep. Now the frost is slowly sublimating away (changing directly from ice to gas) revealing small hexagonal and polygonal patterns a few meters (yards) in size in the darker soil beneath the surface.<br><br>The polygonal patterns on the surface are commonly referred to as ìpatterned groundî  and are often found in high latitude and high alpine environments on Earth. The patterns are the result of annual thermal contraction in ice-cemented soil or permafrost that forms a honeycomb network of small fractures below the surface. This network of fractures is eventually manifested as small shallow troughs at the surface forming the hexagonal and polygonal patterns visible in this image. Bright carbon dioxide frost still fills the shallow troughs accentuating these patterns.
PSP_007217_1755	This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007217_1755_cut_b.jpg'><strong>false-color RGB image</strong></a> shows many layers, or strata, of light-toned rock in the Aureum Chaos region of Mars.<br><br>Data from the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>CRISM instrument</a> have shown that many of these light-toned strata contain sulfate salts and hematite. These minerals were also found in rocks in Meridiani Planum by the Opportunity rover. Both CRISM and the rover have detected sulfate salts with magnesium, calcium, and iron.<br><br>It is possible that the color variations visible in this image (whitish to tan to orange-red tones) are a result of variations in the types of sulfates and other minerals present in these rocks. The low areas between these mesas and rock outcrops are covered by sand, which appears blue in this image. Many sand dunes on Mars contain a mineral called pyroxene, which absorbs and scatters light in such a way that it often appears blue in these false color images. Pyroxene is a common mineral found in basalt, and it is likely that dunes such as these are composed of small grains of weathered, broken-up basalt.<br><br>The spatial relationships between the anhydrous (water-free) minerals found in the dunes, as well as the hydrous (water bearing) minerals in the rock, help us to understand when and how water interacted with the surface of Mars in the past.
PSP_007219_1720	The high resolution of HiRISE allows us to see the many fine layers, or strata, of rock outcrops all over Mars.

Similar light-toned strata are observed elsewhere in the canyon system and the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> has shown that they often contain sulfate salts. The presence of sulfate salts indicate that water once interacted with this area, possibly as fluids that migrated through pre-existing rocks or as shallow evaporating pools of water.<br><br>Much of this region has been covered by dust and sand, which appears brownish-red in the false color image. This material is eroded by wind over time and allows us to see the light-toned rock underneath the surface. There are also dunes (oriented north-south in the subimage) that obscure portions of the outcrop.<br><br>Many outcrops within Ius Chasma and elsewhere on Mars are covered by such dunes and dust, but the high spatial resolution of instruments such as HiRISE and CRISM allow us to see the geology and mineralogy of regions between these dunes to help unravel the geologic history of Mars.
PSP_007242_2650	This image was suggested by Max Fomitchev's class at Penn State University and is of Chasma Borealis that cuts into the northern polar ice cap.<br><br>The class had noted a smooth dark patch in previously acquired images from the Mars Orbiter Camera on Mars Global Surveyor and wondered whether these patches were fog or steam rising from melting ice during Northern spring.<br><br>The class analyzed this image and wrote: "Chasma Borealis is the largest crevasse that gives the northern ice cap its mysterious swirling appearance. Surface features visible in this image reveal (an) exceptionally flat surface containing (crescent-shaped) dunes. These dunes are called barchan dunes, with dune tips or horns that point downwind, providing an indicator of dominant wind direction.<br><br>"The dark patches are actually areas where the carbon dioxide ice in the seasonal polar cap has started to sublimate (evaporating directly from ice to gas). This cap covers a vast sea of dunes at high northern latitudes."<br>
PSP_007243_2050	Mawrth Vallis has a rich mineral diversity, including clay minerals that formed by the chemical alteration of rocks or loose ìregolithî (soil) by water.

PSP_007270_1560	This image covers a portion of Eberswalde Crater which has an ancient deltaic depositional setting. Eberswalde is an approximately 65 kilometer diameter, closed basin crater. <br><br>This image was targeted in the landing ellipse as a possible site for the 2009 <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> mission. The image shows resistant mounds and knobs as well as a scoured surface. <br><br>The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected phyllosilicates (clays) in the bright layers in the crater. One of the ways clays form on Earth is when water erodes rock and makes fine particles which settle out of water; this often occurs in river deltas and lake beds. The delta and meandering channels in Eberswalde Crater (to the west of the landing ellipse) and the detection of phyllosilicates provides evidence for possible persistent aqueous activity on Mars.<br>
PSP_007338_2640	Amazingly, this HiRISE image has <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007338_2640_cut_b.jpg'><strong>captured at least four avalanches,</strong></a> or debris falls, in action.<br><br>The image to the left shows the context of where these avalanches occurred, with white boxes indicating the locations of the more detailed image portions shown to the right (all images are false color). Material, likely including fine-grained ice and dust and possibly including large blocks, has detached from a towering cliff and cascaded to the gentler slopes below. The occurrence of the avalanches is spectacularly revealed by the accompanying clouds of fine material that continue to settle out of the air. The largest cloud (upper images) traces the path of the debris as it fell down the slope, hit the lower slope, and continues downhill, forming a billowing cloud front. This cloud is about 180 meters (590 feet) across and extends about 190 m (625 ft) from the base of the steep cliff. Shadows to the lower left of each cloud illustrate further that these are three dimensional features hanging in the air in front of the cliff face, and not markings on the ground (sun is from the upper right). <br><br>Cameras orbiting Mars have taken thousands of images that have enabled scientists to put together pieces of Marsí geologic history. However, most of them reveal landscapes that havenít changed much in millions of years. Some images taken at different times of year do show seasonal changes from one image to the next; however, it is extremely rare to catch such a dramatic event in action. (Another, unrelated, active process that has been captured by Mars cameras are dust devils.) Observing currently active processes is often a useful tool in unlocking puzzles of the past for scientists studying the Earth. Working from primarily still images, it is harder for scientists studying Mars to rely on this tool. The HiRISE image of avalanching debris is a very rare opportunity to directly do so. <br><br>The scarp in this image is on the edge of the dome of layered deposits centered on Marsí north pole. From top to bottom this impressive cliff is over 700 m (2300 ft) tall and reaches slopes over 60 degrees. The top part of the scarp, to the left of the images, is still covered with bright (white) carbon dioxide frost which is disappearing from the polar regions as spring progresses. The upper mid-toned (pinkish-brownish) section is composed of layers (difficult to see here) that are mostly ice with varying amounts of dust. The darkest deposits below form more gentle slopes, less than 20 degrees, and are mainly composed of two materials: mid-toned layers, possibly ice-rich, that form small shelves, and more mobile, widespread, sand-sized dark material. The wavy forms on the flatter areas to the right are dunes.<br><br>The upper, steepest section, which appears highly fractured due to blocks pulling away from the wall, is the likely source zone for the falls. The precise trigger mechanism is not yet known, although the disappearance of the carbon dioxide frost, the expansion and contraction of the ice in response to temperature differences, a nearby Mars-quake or meteorite impact, and vibrations caused by the first fall in the area, are all possible contributors. <br><br>By comparing images taken before the fall (such as <a href='PSP_007140_2640'<strong>PSP_007140_2640</strong></a>) and after the fall, we may be able to see where material has disappeared from the steep scarp and where it has appeared on the gentler slopes below, possibly as larger blocks, diffuse streaks, or other debris deposits. By imaging this scarp throughout the polar summer, we may be able to determine how much material falls over a given time period. These observations will help determine how much, and at what rate, ice is being eroded from the cliff. Understanding the processes and rates of erosion also help determine how the polar landscape has evolved, and help reveal how volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide ices and gases, move around Mars.<br><br>The precise composition of the ice-dust mixture making up layers in the upper, steepest section of scarp is unknown. However, detailed measurements of the volume of material removed, the configuration of the source area, and the steepness of the slope can be used to estimate physical properties of the material that may relate to composition.
PSP_007346_1405	Hellas Basin is a large impact basin in the southern hemisphere and contains the lowest topographic point on Mars. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007346_1405_cut_b.jpg'><strong>This false-color RGB image</strong></a> acquired by HiRISE shows a small portion of the floor of Hellas Basin, revealing complex folded layers.<br><br>In some places, these layers appear to have been soft and deformed like taffy, experiencing what is know as ìductileî deformation. In other places, the layers are broken and have long fractures, suggesting they deformed as if they were more solid or experienced what is known as ìbrittleî deformation. In some areas the rough texture of the surface is caused by the presence of boulders, and the high resolution of HiRISE now makes it possible to study individual boulders and rocks in this region.<br><br>The folding of these terrains shows that the geologic history of this region is very complex. Additional images such as these and information about the mineralogy as determined by the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> will help scientists to understand how and why these rocks deformed this way.
PSP_007358_2015	<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007358_2015_cut_b.jpg'><strong>This false color RGB image</strong></a> shows the colorful diversity of hydrated minerals in Nili Fossae.<br><br>This region is near one of the proposed landing sites for the upcoming <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover.</strong></a> Though this view is not the same as what the human eye would see, it is clear from this image that there are many varieties of color that are attributed to variations in the minerals and rock types in this location.<br><br>The bright, light-toned bedrock is highly fractured and has been covered by reddish dust in some regions. There are also dunes that are forming in low spots around the knobs, or mesas, of rock. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> has also acquired images over this region and has shown that the rock in these mesas and knobs contain clay minerals, many of which contain iron and magnesium. These clay minerals also contain water.<br><br>One theory to explain the fractured rock is that some water was removed from the clays, causing them to contract, or shrink, and this caused the rock to break. This process is similar to the one that causes cracks to form in mud as it dries on Earth. However, there are other possible ways to form fractures and scientists are currently trying to understand which of these processes caused the fractures observed in the clays on Mars.
PSP_007368_1445	<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007368_1445_cut_b.jpg'><strong>This HiRISE image</strong></a> shows great detail of light-toned knobs in a region known as Ariadnes Colles in the southern hemisphere of Mars. <br><br>As visible in this false color RGB composite, there are high standing light-toned deposits that are covered by darker material. This darker gray-blue material is most likely dust or sand that once covered the region, was since lithified (cemented), and is now being eroded.<br><br>The older bright rock that is now exposed from underneath exhibits raised ridges that are likely fractures that have been filled in with material. The material that filled these fractures is harder than the surrounding rock and takes longer to erode. This causes the fracture fill material to have a raised appearance in the knobs. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> has shown that similar knobs in this region contain minerals with water, indicating that this area contained water at some point in the past.
PSP_007376_1725	The full range of the image shows clear evidence for a thick series of bedrock layers along the walls of Ganges Mensa, located in the Ganges Chasma portion of the large Valles Marineris chasm system.<br><br>These layers are of relatively uniform thickness and can be followed over long distances. The walls have weathered into a series of ridges where the layers can be traced laterally across the topography. The depressions between the ridges are partially filled with wind-blown sediments that form distinct dune fields.

PSP_007392_2650	This image shows layering within the northern hemisphere ice cap, which probably reflects seasonal variability in accumulation of the ice versus sublimation (going from solid to a gas).<br><br>The presence of sand dunes indicates transport of sedimentary materials by wind. Erosion of layering is apparent as a series of undulating ridges at the transition between the layered terrain and the dune field. <br><br>Near the top of the image several vents occur where materials from the shallow subsurface are erupted onto the surface.<br>
PSP_007394_1750	The lower part of this image shows well-defined overlapping channels, which have inverted topography (i.e., they were once low spots that have been filled in with sediments and now eroded in a such a way that they appear as topographically high regions).<br><br>The channels have a winding and intersecting geometry indicating the shifting of the channels over time, a feature consistent with the flow of water in rivers. The channels have small craters that have excavated the channel materials and ejected them to form well-defined rays. There are dark slope streaks (toward the top of the image) showing transport of fine dust down the slope of an eroded bedrock terrain.
PSP_007403_1670	This image shows layered bedrock exposed in the upper reaches of a topographic ridge located in Coprates Chasma. The layers exposed in the ridge visible in the upper part of the full image are darker toned, and possibly of volcanic origin.<br><br>The layers exposed in the lower part of the image are lighter toned and may be composed of hydrated sulfate minerals. An important question is whether or not the layers exposed here extend beneath the layers exposed in the upper part of the image, and are therefore older.  Alternatively, the layers in the lower part of the image may rest on top of the ridge, and therefore be younger than the layered rocks which make up the ridge.
PSP_007417_1755	This image shows yardangs on the floor of Tithonium Chasma. Yardangs are elongated structures formed by aeolian (wind) erosion, developing as the wind exploits weaknesses in the rock, preferentially eroding them and streamlining the remnants. The result is a long, streamlined structure. Yardangs on Earth are found in areas of intense wind erosion, particularly where there is little rainfall; on Mars, yardangs are a common morphology in eroding sedimentary materials since wind is the major erosive process. <br><br>The rocks in this image are light-toned and likely sedimentary. The relatively blunt heads point northeast, towards the source of the wind which formed them. The yardangs have been further eroded and consist of chains of knobs and hills, roughly aligned. These may have once been consolidated ridges. If the rock was not of uniform strength, further erosion could have reduced ridges to aligned knobs by preferentially scouring away weak material.<br><br>Intriguing arcuate depressions are visible around several of the blunt northeast heads. These may be sites of preferential scouring and erosion where the wind flow was disrupted as it first encountered an obstacle. The most distinct examples of this are seen near the center of the image.
PSP_007430_1725	This image shows a section of the stratigraphy in Ius Chasma, one of several troughs of Valles Marineris.<br><br>Mass wasting is visible in the top (north) of the image while wallrock can be seen to the south. The wallrock is thought to be composed of lava flows that cover much of the region around Valles Marineris. <br><br>Most of the image shows the floor of Ius Chasma which consists of aeolian ripples, debris, and layered rocks. The layered rocks are particularly interesting because they are light-toned in brightness and exposed both on the floor and at the base of a hill where wall rock is visible at the top. The observation that some light-toned layered rocks occur stratigraphically below wall rock indicates an older age for these rocks. Their light-toned nature could be due to compositions unlike the lavas, including sulfates or salts, which are minerals found where water once existed. Hence, water may have laid down these sediments a long time ago before lavas buried them. <br><br>Only where erosion and expansion have exposed enough stratigraphy can we see the whole geologic history of this region, which has been captured so well in this HiRISE image.<br><br>
PSP_007464_1985	This image shows the central uplift within an impact crater to the west of Nili Fossae.  Images of crater central uplifts like this one provide rare views of the rock types that exist miles beneath the modern-day surface of Mars.<br><br>After the impact occurred, the craterís central floor rebounded upward, forming a ring of hills and raising deeply buried rocks up to Martian surface.  Infrared spectrometers such as <a href="http://themis.asu.edu">THEMIS</a> and <a href="http://crism.jhuapl.edu">CRISM</a> have found that some of these rocks in the craterís central uplift contain minerals that are intriguing and atypical for Mars, such as quartz, clays, and other water-bearing silicate minerals.<br><br>This portion of the image shows some of the central uplift rocks in fine detail. Blocks measuring from a few meters to over a hundred meters (10 to over 300 feet) across have coloration differences, suggesting that their compositions are different. Some of the largest blocks are internally layered, implying that they are blocks of sedimentary rock. The impact process has shuffled these diverse blocks into this disorganized array known as impact breccia.  Some of the materials that appear dark blue <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007464_1985_cut.jpg'><strong>in this enhanced color image</strong></a> are probably patches of sand overlying the lighter-toned breccia.<br>
PSP_007481_1560	This image covers a portion of Eberswalde Crater, which has an ancient deltaic depositional setting. Eberswalde is an approximately 65 kilometer diameter, closed basin crater. This image was targeted in the landing ellipse as a possible site for the 2009 <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> mission. The image shows resistant mounds and knobs as well as a scoured surface. <br><br>The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has detected phyllosilicates (clays) in the bright layers in the crater. One of the ways clays form on Earth is when water erodes rock and makes fine particles which settle out of water; this often occurs in river deltas and lake beds. The delta and meandering channels in Eberswalde Crater (to the west of the landing ellipse) and the detection of phyllosilicates provides evidence for possible persistent aqueous activity on Mars.<br>
PSP_007492_2265	This image reveals hexagonal and polygonal patterns formed by networks of soil troughs on the floor of a valley in the Deuteronilus Mensae region, located on the northern edge of Arabia Terra and borders the Martian southern highlands and northern lowlands.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007492_2265_cut.jpg'><strong>The polygonal patterns</strong></a> indicate that the surface has undergone stress, potentially caused by subsidence (sinking), desiccation (drying out), or thermal contraction. These polygon features are similar to permafrost thermal-contraction polygons that form in polar and high alpine regions on Earth by seasonal-to-annual contraction of the subsoil. On Earth, such polygon features are indicative of the presence of ground ice and are commonly referred to as ìpatterned ground.î The patterns are the result of thermal contraction in ice-cemented soil or permafrost that forms a honeycomb network of small fractures below the surface. The network of fractures is eventually manifested as shallow troughs at the surface, forming the hexagonal and polygonal patterns visible in this image.<br><br>The polygons in this scene average approximately 100 meters (110 yards) in size and appear to be higher in elevation in the center than in the surrounding troughs. Boulders are accumulated in the center of the polygons and dunes are visible in several of the troughs. <br><br>The landforms we observe here most likely indicate that ice-rich permafrost is present or has been present in the past. <br>
PSP_007493_2650	This image shows an exposure of the north polar layered deposits (center). The layering visible here might have been formed by recent climate variations on Mars, similar to ice ages on Earth.<br><br>While the polar layered deposits are mostly water ice, exposures such as this are typically covered by a layer of red dust, protecting the underlying ice from evaporation during the summer. This dusty layer hides the internal composition of the polar layered deposits from view, but variations in the slopes of the surfaces of the layers are still visible.<br><br>The slope of each layer is probably affected by the internal composition, so the topography of exposures like this is of interest to scientists. When this image was taken (northern spring), the surface was mostly covered by seasonal carbon dioxide frost. This white frost layer helps to highlight the surface slopes because the visible brightness variations are mainly caused by topographic variations.  Therefore, this image will be useful for photoclinometric, or "shape from shading" analyses that can yield topographic maps limited only by the resolution of the image.<br>
PSP_007547_1895	This image covers where the southern branch of Shalbatana Vallis opens into Chryse Planitia, showing a variety of boulders that have moved down slope leaving tracks on the surface. These boulders may have been thrown out from low-energy secondary craters, or simply eroded out of the above rocky cliff.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007547_1895_cut.jpg'><strong>In the subimage,</strong></a> the left frame shows boulders moving in two directions, indicating that they had different sources. The right frame shows a boulder about 4 meters in diameter in the bottom left, having left a track that begins in the upper right. This boulder rolled down the hill, appears to have jumped the crater, bounced a few times, and then rolled to a halt.
PSP_007592_1425	Based on MOC image M17-01035, the gullies visible in this southern hemisphere crater were thought to occur on top of dunes. This HiRISE image reveals that the ìdunesî are actually probably extensional fractures along the crater wall.<br><br>The debris aprons formed on top of the fractures indicating that gully activity was more recent that the fracture formation. Interestingly, the morphology (shape, size) of the gullies varies at different locations along the crater wall. The alcoves (source regions) of the south-facing gullies appear to be deeply cut into the wall, while the alcoves of the southwest-facing gullies are almost non-existent. It is unknown what causes alcove shape, but the resistance of the surrounding rocks and amount, if any, of water activity might play a role. <br><br>The crater floor has a lobe-shaped feature on its northern half. This feature might have formed when ice-rich material flowed off the crater wall onto the floor. This may be related to the extensional fractures underlying the gullies.<br>
PSP_007596_1295	This is one of the many new impact sites that have been dated using repeat imagery of the same spot on Mars. A dark spot was seen in an image from the <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/'>Context camera</a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a spot that was not present in previous observations from other missions. When HiRISE followed up with this image, an impact origin was confirmed. In this case, it wasn't just one crater that had formed, but more than thirty.  <br><br>A cluster of craters was created because the asteroid or comet colliding with Mars broke up in the atmosphere. Even though the Martian atmosphere is very thin compared to Earth's, the impacting objects are traveling at such high speeds that the force of friction is very large. Some of that frictional force goes into slowing the object down. If the impactor is weak, perhaps made of porous material or already fractured by previous impacts in the asteroid belt, it can also break apart as it hurtles through the atmosphere. Each of the fragments collides with the surface at very high velocity, forming separate craters.<br><br>The largest crater in the cluster is only approximately 4.5 meters (about 15 feet) across, and the smallest ones are so tiny, they can't even be seen with HiRISE resolution. However, the dark streaks emanating from them can be seen. These streaks are either ejecta (material that was excavated during the impact) or areas where lighter-colored dust has been removed, exposing the darker layer underneath.  The dark streaks meandering through the scene are probably not related to the impact. They are more likely the tracks of dust devils, which similarly remove lighter-colored dust to leave darker trails in their wake.<br><br>This particular impact was probably quite oblique - in other words, the object came in at a steep angle to the vertical. One clue that indicates an oblique impact is the asymmetry of the ejecta rays. This asymmetry can also be used to estimate the direction from which the asteroid or comet came. The ejecta rays have a distinctive pattern, also seen in experimental impacts, with more ejecta toward the east and west, and very little to the north. The cluster itself is also elongated along the same orientation, strengthening the argument for an oblique impact in that direction.<br>

PSP_007653_2010	This image reveals bright slope streaks in Bahram Vallis, a long sinuous valley that winds across northeastern Lunae Planum and Xanthe Terra to the circum-Chyrse basin.<br><br>Typically, dark and light-toned slope streaks appear together on light-toned slopes. This scene is a rare case in which only bright streaks are <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007653_2010_cut.jpg'><strong>visible on a dark surface</strong></a>. Slope streaks generally start at a point source and widen downslope as a single streak or branch into multiple streaks. Some of the slope streaks show evidence that downslope movement is being diverted around obstacles, such as large boulders, and a few appear to originate at boulders or clumps of rocky material. <br><br>Many hypotheses have been proposed for the formation of slope streaks including dry avalanching, geochemical weathering, liquid stains or flows, and moisture wickering. Recent observations from HiRISE images have revealed that the interior of slope streaks is lower in elevation than the surroundings indicating that material must have been removed and then deposited in the formation of the streak.<br><br>Slope streak formation is among the few known processes currently active on Mars. Where they appear together, dark slope streaks cross cut and lie on top of the older and lighter-toned streaks leading to the belief that lighter-toned streaks are dark streaks that have lightened with time as new dust settled on their surface. Over the course of several years, MOC images from this region did not reveal any new dark or light-toned slope streaks suggesting that streak formation is not currently active here. HiRISE can continue to monitor this region for new slope streaks and changes in tone of old streaks.<br>
PSP_007673_2575	This image was taken over the north polar region of Mars, just south of the layered ice cap. The image shows a 10 kilometer diameter impact crater during northern spring, still covered by carbon dioxide ice/frost, and perhaps some water ice/frost.<br><br>There are color variations due to the presence of reddish dust mixed with the ice/frost in different proportions, and the dark and relatively blue spots form when carbon dioxide gas is released in small jets from beneath the ice.  <br><br>There are no clear examples of small impact craters superimposed on the large crater, although there are many shallow depressions that might be degraded craters. This seems puzzling because small (approximately 10 meters in diameter) craters form much more frequently than 10 kilometer craters. In fact, they form about a billion times more frequently!  The reason why there arenít any sharp small craters is due to the fact that the ice destroys them, and does so rapidly, compared with the cratering rate.<br><br>Ice on Mars does not melt in the current climate, but it does expand and contract with temperature variations and it can flow.
PSP_007676_1385	This observation shows sand dunes within the Hellespontus region of Mars.<br><br>The sand appears to come from the layered mesas and knobs, features that have been <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007676_1385_cuta.jpg'>eroded by powerful winds</a></strong>. The dunes here have a morphology indicating formative winds blowing from east to west (from right to left).<br><br>The primary indicator for this is the orientation of the barchan dunes, a dune type that on Earth has its horns in the downwind direction. Also, the steepest faces of the dunes are on the dunesí eastern side, indicating easterly winds.<br><br>In addition to the barchans, some of the dunes are organized into a ìseif,î, or longitudinal, form whereby their long axis is parallel to the wind. These are seen emanating from the sand sheets next to the mesas and knobs, <strong><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007676_1385_cutb.jpg'>as well as from some barchan horns</a></strong>.

PSP_007696_1720	This image shows a fan of sediment on the floor of a large impact crater on Mars. The fan sits at the mouth of a small valley just to the south of the image.<br><br>The valley was likely carved by groundwater &ldquo;sapping&rdquo; (eroding the channel upstream by undermining the slope), and deposited this fan of material when it reached the broad crater floor. This might have formed a temporary lake within the crater, depending on the rates of transport and loss of water. <br><br>Several coarse stair-steps in the fan may correspond to layers, and form arcs around the mouth of the valley. There is little indication of smaller-scale layers such as those observed in some other fan deposits on Mars, likely indicating that this fan was deposited under different conditions or the layers are not well exposed. <br><br>The current surface has many light-toned patches, circular or irregular in shape. In some cases these appear to be shallow pits, but many appear level with their surroundings. The most likely explanation for these is that they are old impact craters, mostly eroded and filled with dust. Marks like this might also be boulders in a debris-flow deposit that later turned to rock and eroded&mdash;a similar effect is observed in some megabreccia elsewhere on Mars. However, the large size of some of the patches (as much as 25 meters) would require very large boulders, making this unlikely.
PSP_007701_2095	This image shows a part of the floor of a large, heavily modified crater in the Nilosyrtis Mensae region. The cliffs in the northern and southern parts of this image are walls of an irregular erosional pit and expose some of the infilling material. The crater itself was mostly filled in and then eroded.<br><br>An interesting aspect of the rocks at the edge of the pit is the widespread fracturing. The rocks of the upper layer are broken up along cracks called joints. On Earth, these commonly form when rocks are subjected to stresses, due to factors like cooling or the removal of weight due to erosion.  <br><br>The upper layer forms the cliffs because it is relatively hard to erode, and protects the underlying material. This commonly happens when a lava flow covers weaker sedimentary rocks, but the joints at this site suggest that this resistant layer might be sedimentary. The rock appears to be breaking into broad, thin slabs; lava flows often fracture into columns or relatively uniform blocks as they cool. 
PSP_007704_1765	Miyamoto Crater is located in southwest Meridiani Planum (and southwest of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landing site). This image shows fairly smooth plains and some areas covered by wind streaks. <br><br>The streaks suggest that wind is an active process here, depositing surface material downwind in this distinctive form.<br><br>This landing site is adjacent to the hematite-bearing plains unit where the Opportunity rover sits. The <strong><a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>CRISM</a></strong> instrument has detected phyllosilicates (clay minerals) at this landing site, which scientists believe to have formed in the presence of water.<br><br>The <strong><a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'>Mars Science Laboratory</a></strong> rover would investigate the mineral diversity here, which includes phyllosilicates and sulfate minerals.
PSP_007712_2670	This photo shows a portion of the north polar layered deposits. The photo was taken in northern spring so the deposits are still covered by carbon dioxide frost or ice.<br><br>However, the different layers of the deposit can still be seen from the variations in relief; in fact, the frost helps to accentuate the relief. If the layers in this deposit can be matched with layers in other areas, then the geometry of layering in the current northern polar cap can be better constrained.<br><br>These layered deposits are thought to be ice and dust deposits that record climate changes over thousands of years.
PSP_007726_2565	More than 10 percent of the surface area north of 65 degrees North on Mars has some type of cover by windblown sand dunes. This HiRISE image shows large barchan (crescent-shaped), barchanoid and some smaller dome-shaped dunes.<br><br>The image is of a location where the first significant change to sand dunes was reported on Mars (Bourke et al, 2008). That study used a time series of MOC images taken over a period of three Mars years and showed that two 20 meter-wide dome dunes disappeared and a third shrank by an estimated 15 percent. The HiRISE image confirms that the dune forms no longer exist but, interestingly, suggests that the sediment removal is ongoing as the third dune has been reduced in volume.<br><br>Other, larger dunes in the location do not show apparent change: more time or more precise measurements to display evidence of change is needed. Alternately, the sediment in the larger dunes may be unavailable for transport at the present time due to induration. Nevertheless, the change observed in the small dome dunes indicates that not all dunes on Mars are effectively stabilized and immobile.
PSP_007738_2145	This image shows a portion of Hrad Vallis, an approximately 400 meter (1300 feet) deep and 800 kilometer (500 mile) long depression located in the Elysium Planitia.<br><br>Hrad Vallis is one of several channel systems that are found just west of the Elysium volcanoes. The scoured floor of Hrad Vallis shows the effects of erosion, presumably by water. <br><br>Flowing water in the past has carved and sculpted rocky masses into streamlined shapes or islands. The streamlined islands often have sharp edges and are narrower at the downstream end and wider at the upstream end. The streamlined islands visible here are located in an area where the flow condensed from the fractured terrain of the Hrad Valles headwaters (to the southeast) to a more regular channel (to the northwest).
PSP_007744_2055	The Mawrth Vallis region of Mars is an area of particular interest because of the identification of clay minerals by imaging spectrometers such as <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These types of minerals (called ìphyllosilicatesî by geologists) are usually formed in the presence of water, and may mark the existence of a habitable environment billions of years ago. The mineralogic variations are colorful in HiRISE imagery, too, thanks to the cameraís near infrared capability. The colors are not natural colors that you would see with your own eyes, but they can discriminate between different compositions.<br><br>The crater near the middle of this image was formed after the layers were deposited. Different layers are clearly visible in the wall of the crater <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007744_2055_cut.jpg'><strong>in the subimage</strong></a> (approxinately 540 meters across). This allows scientists to measure the thickness of the layers, and to observe how they alternated. The crater gives us a peek into what lies beneath, which will help interpret the history of this part of Mars.<br><br>These images contain gaps (black areas) where data was lost in transmission from the MRO spacecraft to radio dishes on the ground. This happens when there are mechanical difficulties with the ground stations or they are intentionally re-pointed to a different part of the sky due to unexpected problems on other spacecraft exploring the solar system.
PSP_007751_1640	This image was planned to take a closer look at what appears to be a segment of a crater ray.<br><br>Relatively recent impacts form rays like those of Tycho Crater on the Moon. There, rays stand out because they are brighter than the surroundings, but on Mars they are best found from nighttime infrared images, sensitive to temperature variations, acquired by the <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'><strong>THEMIS instrument</strong></a> on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. The rays consist of thin layers of ejecta from both the primary (source) crater and the millions or even billions of small secondary craters. The crater ejecta and surge deposits churned up by the interacting ejecta get mixed and deposited together.<br><br>This ray segment is approximately 1000 kilometers away from the source crater (15 km diameter), located at 16.95 N, 141.73 E; <a href='/PSP_003611_1970'><strong>see PSP_003611_1970</strong></a>). This source crater, which doesn&rsquo;t yet have an official name, is now the largest known rayed crater on Mars.<br><br>There are more than half a million small craters seen in this one image, which covers less than 1 percent of the ray system. This image will be used to count the number of secondary craters and measure their sizes, to determine the size-frequency distribution. This work will help scientists to better understand impact processes, the origins of small craters, and the modification of landscapes.  
PSP_007767_1970	This false color image covers the western half of the central peak of Toro Crater, a 42 kilometer diameter crater in Syrtis Major.<br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_007767_1970_cut.jpg'><strong>The subimage</strong></a> shows a close-up of one of the features that make Toro Crater a great target for HiRISE images: colorful patches of megabreccia. Breccia is a mixture of chunks of rock (clasts) that have been broken by an energetic geologic event, such as a landslide or crater-forming impact, that are then cemented together in a finer grained material. Megabreccia features very large clasts that are big enough for HiRISE to see on the surface - some even larger than 30 feet across. In this 200 meter (about 1/8 of a mile) diameter exposure of megabreccia, clasts of various colors (indicating different kinds of rocks) and sizes have been exposed in the uplifted central peak of Toro Crater.<br><br>Scientists think that megabreccia may have formed early in Mars' history during a period of frequent impact crater formation. These early rocks were then covered by younger rock layers. HiRISE frequently targets the central peaks of craters, because these features tend to bring up rocks like these megabreccia that are usually buried under the surface.<br><br>So far, HiRISE has found megabreccia in more than a hundred places on Mars. In many of these locations, CRISM has identified clays in the material cementing the clasts together, providing yet another motivation for the study of megabreccia.<br><br>HiRISE first imaged Toro Crater (in <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_005842_1970'>PSP_005842_1970</a>) because <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'>CRISM</a> detected hydrated minerals, like clays, on the floor. The instruments of MRO often observe the same areas of Mars simultaneously through a process known as "ride-alongs." That earlier image was so interesting that HiRISE has since acquired a number of images over the crater (<a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006910_1975'>PSP_006910_1975</a>, <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007266_1970'>PSP_007266_1970</a>,<a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_011538_1970'>ESP_011538_1970</a>)
PSP_007769_9010	HiRISE acquired two dramatic views of the Martian moon, Phobos, on 23 March 2008. Observation <strong><a href='/images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9010_RED.jpg'>PSP_007769_9010</a></strong>, acquired at a distance of 6,800 kilometers from Phobos, provides surface detail at 6.8 m/pixel scale and a object diameter of about 3,200 pixels. The second observation, <strong><a href='/images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9015_RED.jpg'>PSP_007769_9015 </a></strong>providing a closer look at 5,800 km, views the surface at slightly more detail (5.8 m/pixel with an object diameter of about 4,000 pixels). <br><br>The two images were taken within 10 minutes of each other and show roughly the same features, but from a different angle so that they can be combined to <a href='images/2008/details/phobos/anaglyph.jpg'><strong>yield a stereo</strong></a> view. (<strong><a href='/media/clips/phobos-clip.mov'>Watch a short clip</a></strong> of both observations: 204KB, QuickTime.)<br><br>The illuminated part of Phobos visible in the images is about 21 km across. Images from previous spacecraft have been of smaller pixel scale (for example, Mars Global Surveyor got data at 4 m/pixel, because this spacecraft came closer to Phobos), but the HiRISE images have greater signal-to-noise, making the new data some of the best ever for Phobos.  <br><br>The most prominent feature in the images is the <a href='images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9010_IRB_StickneyU.jpg'><strong>large impact crater Stickney,</strong></a> in the lower right. With a diameter of 9 km, it is the largest feature on Phobos. A series of grooves and crater chains is obvious on the other parts of the moon. Although many appear radial to Stickney in the images, previous studies show that the grooves radiate from a different point on Phobos.  Hypotheses for their formation vary.  Some scientists believe the grooves and crater chains are related to the formation of Stickney, whereas others think they may have formed from ejecta from impacts on Mars that later collided with Phobos. The lineated textures on the walls of Stickney and other large craters are landslides formed from materials falling into the crater interiors in the weak Phobos gravity (less than 1/1000th the gravity on Earth)<br><br><span class='sub-heading'>IRB COLOR</span><br>Both <a href='images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9010_IRB.jpg'><strong>PSP_007769_9010</strong></a>  and <a href='images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9015_IRB.jpg'><strong>PSP_007769_9015</strong></a> were made by combining data from HiRISEís blue/green, red, and near-infrared channels. The color data accentuate details not apparent in the black and white images.  For example, materials near the rim of Stickney appear bluer than the rest of Phobos.  Based on analogy with materials on our own moon, this could mean this surface is fresher, and therefore younger, than other parts of Phobos.<br><br><span class='sub-heading'>ìMARSSHINEî</span><br><a href='images/2008/details/phobos/PSP_007769_9015_MarsShine.jpg'><strong>This is a close-up</strong></a> and enhanced part of image PSP_007769_9015. In the original image, detail in the black, un-illuminated portion is not apparent. However, seen in enhanced detail here, craters are clearly visible.  This faint illumination is from reflected light off of Mars (ìMarsshineî). This is directly analogous to ìEarthshine,î where reflected sunlight from our planet illuminates the dark side of the Moon. The ability to see features on Phobos illuminated by Marsshine demonstrates the high sensitivity of the HiRISE camera.<br><br><br><span class='sub-heading'>BACKGROUND</span><br>Phobos, and the second Martian moon, Deimos, are interesting for several reasons. Both objects are small, with average diameters of just 22 and 12 km, respectively.  At this size, their gravity is insufficient (less than 1/1000th of Earth) to pull them into spherical shapes, in contrast to the larger moons and planets in the Solar System.<br><br>Both moons are tidally locked to Mars, meaning, like our own moon relative to Earth, they present the same side to Mars all the time.  The small size and composition (determined from spectroscopy) of Phobos and Deimos make them very similar to some asteroids. Most asteroids are located in a belt between Mars and Jupiter, with others having orbits that cross that of Mars.  Therefore, it is possible that Phobos and Deimos are captured asteroids. Other hypotheses are that they formed with Mars in the early Solar System, or are composed of material blasted off of Mars by impacts.<br><br>HiRISE can provide new imaging, color, and topographic (from stereo) data on these objects, thereby helping to constrain their origin and subsequent evolution. While this caption focuses on observations of Phobos, images of Deimos may be acquired at a later date.

PSP_007779_2570	In this image, we can see that the north pole is surrounded by a vast ìseaî of basaltic sand dunes. In northern winter a seasonal polar cap composed of carbon dioxide ice (dry ice) forms and the surrounding dunes become covered with frost. In the spring, the ice sublimates (evaporates directly from ice to gas) loosening and moving tiny dust particles.<br><br>The bright portions of the dunes in this image are areas still covered with seasonal frost while dark spots are areas where the frost is gone or dark dust has cascaded down the sides of the dune.<br><br>The dunes imaged here are similar to barchan dunes that are commonly found in desert regions on Earth. Barchan dunes are generally crescent-shaped with a steep slip face bordered by horns oriented in the downwind direction. Barchan dunes form by winds blowing mainly in one direction and thus are good indicators of the dominant wind direction when the dunes formed.
PSP_007801_2610	This image shows defrosting sand dunes near the north polar region of Mars.<br><br>Around Mars&rsquo; north pole is a vast region or &ldquo;sea&rdquo; of sand dunes that become covered with carbon dioxide frost or ice in the northern hemisphereís winter. The light areas indicate that parts of the dunes are still covered in frost or ice.<br><br>As Mars&rsquo; northern hemisphere enters into spring and begins to warm, the carbon dioxide sublimates (turns directly from a solid to a gas). The carbon dioxide sublimates in surprising ways, with trapped gas bursting through the ice in jets that leave dark streaks when the wind is blowing<br><br>During the summer, all the frost will have sublimed leaving dark sand dunes. The unfrosted dunes are dark because the sand is derived from dark volcanic rocks.
PSP_007805_2505	This image shows the changing seasonal frost patterns on Louth Crater, located at latitude 70 N. This crater contains a mound covered by water frost that persists throughout the year, which is unusual for this latitude.<br><br>The seasonal carbon dioxide frost deposited during northern winter can also reach this latitude. At the time this image was acquired in northern spring, the carbon dioxide frost is in the process of sublimating back into the atmosphere.  <br><br>There are sand dunes near the edge of the mound, which become clear of frost in the summer. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007805_2505_cut.jpg'><strong>This subimage</strong></a> shows a comparison of these dunes acquired in late northern summer (<a href='PSP_001700_2505'><strong> PSP_001700_2505</strong></a>, top) with the newer image. It is hard to believe this is the same piece of ground because the brightness patterns are so different due to the large temperature changes throughout the year.
PSP_007808_1575	This image covers the southern slope of an old impact crater inside a larger and still older crater, in the Martian highlands.<br><br>Valley networks are often found on the most ancient Martian terrains, suggesting that Mars was a very different world more than 3 billion years ago. There are two prominent valleys near the center of the image that merge into a single northeast-trending valley (i.e., going to the upper right; be sure to look at the map-projected images that have north up.) There are bright ripples on the floors of the valleys.  Although water may have carved these valleys long ago, the ripples are much more recent features created by the wind, which is channelized by the topography. <br><br>The terrain is heavily covered by dust or other wind-blown materials, muting the underlying surface features. Bright lines behind some boulders and other topography are called ìwind tailsî and are deposited in the lee of obstacles, thereby indicating wind direction (most wind tails here seem to extend to the north-northwest from obstacles, indicating winds from the south-southeast). Small, sharp impact craters are best vsibile over the smooth mantled regions; these craters probably formed in just the past few million years, which is very recent in geologic time.
PSP_007810_1885	This image, captured on 27 March 2008, reveals unprecedented detail of an enigmatic feature on the Martian surface. <br><br>With a scale of 56 centimeters per pixel (about two feet), the image shows the upper reaches of an outflow channel in Ares Valles. Outflow channels are the sites where massive catastrophic releases of a fluid, presumably water, poured out of the subsurface in flooding events on orders of magnitude larger than anything we have ever witnessed on Earth.<br><br>The image, oriented diagonal to the channel, just covers the channel from bank to bank. It is near the release point for the wateróa jumbled region called chaotic terrain to the south.  Impact craters on the channel provide a means of estimating the age of the flooding event, although the channel bottom may be covered by younger materials such as lava. There are also sand dunes in relatively low areas that formed long after the flooding had ceased.<br><br>The <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/pathfinder.html'><strong>Mars Pathfinder</strong></a> landed to the northwest of here in 1997 (see <a href='PSP_001890_1995'><strong>PSP_001890_1995</strong></a>). 
PSP_007820_1505	This image shows outcrops of light-toned layered rocks in the northern part of Hellas Planitia, the floor of a massive, ancient impact crater.<br><br>The floor of Hellas includes the lowest parts of the Martian surface, and has been proposed as the site of ancient lakes or seas. <br><br>The layers show some variations in color and brightness, alternating between light and dark material. The bright layers are extensively fractured into angular boulders and blocks, while the dark layers appear relatively smooth, although this could be due in part to sand or dust covering them. This alternation also appears to correspond to stairstep-like topography in places, suggesting that some layers are more resistant to erosion than others. However, in other areas, the slope is relatively constant. <br><br>Light-toned layered rocks are found in many sites on Mars, including much of the north rim of Hellas. They could have been deposited in many ways: volcanic ash, wind-blown sand,  river or lake deposits. The occurrence of some of these around the edge of the deep floor of Hellas raises the possibility that these layers were deposited on the floor of an ancient lake, but other mechanisms are also possible.
PSP_007822_1415	The ejecta blanket of a large (20 kilometer diameter) impact crater is shown here in vivid detail. The ejecta formed strong linear patterns in the topography that extend radially outward from the crater. This ejecta is rocky material that was ejected from the crater as a result of the high-velocity impact of an object about 100-200 meters in diameter, which probably escaped from the asteroid belt.<br><br>Since the impact event, this ejecta has been subject to millions of years of wind erosion that may have etched the surface and accentuated the radial pattern. There are also small-scale landforms such as fractured mounds that may have formed due to the presence of subsurface ice.

Features like this are often found surrounding isolated mountains in this area. Material flowed down off of the top of the mountain and settled in an area around its base. The bottom of the image (to the south) shows the base of the mountain, where material is sliding off and <a href='images/2010/details/cut/PSP_007832_1385_cut1.jpg'><strong>piling up into ridges</strong></a>. The top of the image (to the north) shows the lobate edge of the apron, where it stopped flowing.<br><br>Recently, the <a href='http://pds-geosciences.wustl.edu/missions/mro/sharad.htm'><strong>SHARAD</strong></a> (Shallow ground-penetrating radar) instrument (also on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with HiRISE) measured large amounts of water ice mixed into this and other debris aprons.  The water ice is what gives the apron its unique texture, which is especially clear at HiRISE's high resolution. Parallel ridges and grooves  indicate material has moved slowly while remaining solid - a process called "creep."  Pits and buttes may have formed when the dust- and debris-covered ice cracked and sublimated (went directly from a solid to a gas phase).<br><br>We can also use this HiRISE image to study the small impact craters found in these areas. Debris aprons like this one have fewer craters than their surroundings. Because impacts generally occur indiscriminately over all of Mars, this means that either the debris apron is younger than its surroundings, or some process is erasing craters on the apron - a process which is not occurring as rapidly on the surrounding plains.<br><br>The fact that this apron is rich in water ice is a clue to what is happening. Another clue is the craters on the apron themselves: they have a <a href='images/2010/details/cut/PSP_007832_1385_cut2.jpg'><strong>different appearance</strong></a> than most craters.  <a href='images/2010/details/cut/PSP_007832_1385_cut3.jpg'><strong>Some of these degraded craters</strong></a> are "inverted" (higher in the middle than at the edges, which is the opposite of normal craters).<br><br>Craters like this have been modified, so we can tell the surface has been active at some time since the impact that formed the crater. For this reason we can't estimate the age of the flow by counting craters, like we are be able to do on some surfaces. However, we can use these craters to study the processes that are actively modifying the apron material.<br>
PSP_007840_1800	This image shows geologically young lava flows west of Pavonis Mons. Pavonis Mons is one of the three Tharsis Montes, a group of giant shield volcanoes (they are broad and have gentle slopes, like a shield).<br><br>The lava flows <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_007800_007899/PSP_007840_1800/PSP_007840_1800_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>show up best</strong></a> in the reduced-scale browse images.  Zooming in at full resolution, we see that this area is mantled by thick dust deposits that have been eroded into northwest-southeast trending landforms. These patterns are used by scientists to map what direction the strongest winds blow on average and how the direction changes through time.<br><br>We can also see long linear tracks that are lighter-toned than the surrounding surface, and <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_007800_007899/PSP_007840_1800/PSP_007840_1800_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>bluer in color.</strong></a> These tracks are formed by dust devils that remove some of the surface dust. The older, compacted dust has a different color that the fresh dust. Notice that the dust devils did not move in the same direction as the predominant winds that streamlined the surface. 
PSP_007896_1890	This image shows ìwrinkleî ridges running north to south across the lava-covered plains of Elysium Planitia.<br><br>Wrinkle ridges are tectonic landforms produced by lateral compression, or shortening. They are typically snaking, irregular ridges that can branch apart and rejoin. The wrinkle ridges in this image are in some of the youngest lavas on Mars. The lavas erupted from a fissure at the head of the Athabasca Valles channel system between one million and two hundred million years ago.<br><br>In the main, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007896_1890_cut.jpg'><strong>it looks as if these ridges existed before</strong></a> lava flooded the region. For example, some parts of the ridge crests are not covered by lava, suggesting that they were already topographically high features. Similarly, the surface of the lava flow is jagged and rough (indicating that the flow-top crumpled) on either side of the wrinkle ridges, but relatively smooth between and immediately downstream (east) of the ridges. This suggests that the wrinkle ridges acted as obstacles, slowing the flow of the lava.<br><br>However, there are also hints that the wrinkle ridges deformed the lava flow after it had solidified. On the east face of the western wrinkle ridge and near the top (north) of the HiRISE image (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007896_1890_cut.jpg'><strong>it looks as if these ridges existed before</strong>see the subimage</strong></a>), the lava flow is broken at the base of the ridge. It seems likely that although the wrinkle ridges were largely formed before lava covered the region, they continued to be uplifted after the cessation of volcanism.
PSP_007925_1990	Billions of years ago, this water-carved channel in Nili Fossae region transported sediments across the Martian surface and deposited them on the floor of an impact crater just south of this image. The sediments were deposited in a delta-like mound on the floor of Jezero Crater, suggesting that the crater may have contained a lake at the time.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007925_1990_cut.jpg'><strong>This portion of the image</strong></a> shows a section of the channel in greater detail. Wind-blown dunes or ripples now cover much of the channel floor, but in some places the older channel floor is visible. Here, the channel bed has a layered appearance. The plains outside the channel are fractured into polygonal patterns. The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> has detected water-bearing clay minerals in these plains, which were eroded by flows down the channel. Clays are also seen in the sediments deposited on the floor of Jezero Crater.<br><br>These clues in the form and composition of the Martian surface provide insights into an ancient era when liquid water may have been more common at the surface.
PSP_007930_2310	This image shows Martian dissected mantle terrain in the Tempe Terra region, located on the northeastern flank of the Tharsis volcanotectonic province. <br><br>The dissected mantle terrain is observed between 30 and 60 degrees of latitude in both hemispheres of Mars. This mantle terrain is commonly believed to be young and to consist of a thin layer of an ice-dust mixture, perhaps deposited during the last periods of high obliquity. Martian dissected mantle terrain is often characterized by various erosional features, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_007930_2310_cut.jpg'><strong>such as scalloped depressions</strong></a> that give it a pitted or dissected texture.<br><br>The presence of scalloped pits has led to hypotheses of the removal of subsurface material, such as interstitial ice, by sublimation (ice going directly from the solid state to the gas state). Their formation most likely involves development of oval-to scalloped-shaped depressions that may coalesce together, leading to the formation of large areas of pitted terrain. Scalloped pits typically have a steep pole-facing scarp (north in this observation) and a shallower equator-facing slope. <br><br>Formation of scalloped depressions may be a process that is still active today.
PSP_007946_2035	This HiRISE image captures a small part of the giant scarp that marks the base of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. This scarp was most likely produced by massive landslides as the volcano falls apart under its own weight. Earlier images from the Mars Observer Camera on the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/'><strong>Mars Global Surveyor</strong></a> spacecraft showed that there were layers in this area. HiRISE now reveals new details about them.  <br><br>The layers consist of ledges of hard rock protruding out of the slope. This rock is fractured but not disrupted; such fractures are called ìjointsî by geologists. (If there were motion along them, then they would merit the name ìfaults.î) These joints are not as narrow or well-developed as in lava flows that we interpret to be water-cooled. It is not surprising that we do not find evidence for liquid water at this high elevation.  <br><br>In most places the rock is covered by dust and <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/mass.php'><strong>mass wasting</strong></a> material. However, in the southern part of this image the stack of rocks (stratigraphy) is well-exposed. The rock between the hard ledges consists of broken up rock (breccia), with some blocks a few meters in diameter.  <br><br>Overall, this pattern of hard rock encased in breccia is consistent with a type of lava called ìaaî by Hawaiians and geologists. The solidifying surface of aa lavas are broken up as the flow moves, producing a carapace of debris surrounding the liquid lava. When the lava flow finally stops, the liquid interior freezes into a hard layer. The contraction during cooling produces irregular jointing like that seen in this HiRISE image.
PSP_007959_1980	Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system, has a large depression at its top. This depression, called a &ldquo;caldera&rdquo; by geologists, is caused by the collapse of the top of the volcano as magma is drained out from an underground holding chamber.<br><br>Previous studies have demonstrated multiple collapses, indicating that there were holding chambers in slightly different locations within the volcano that emptied at various times. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_007900_007999/PSP_007959_1980/PSP_007959_1980_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>This HiRISE image</strong></a> examines the walls of one such collapse which exposes the layers of rock within the uppermost part of Olympus Mons.  <br><br>In the sections not covered by dust, hundreds of thin discontinuous layers are visible. The thicknesses and widths of these layers are similar to those of the lava flows seen on the surface of Olympus Mons. This confirms the assumption that the volcano is built up of many thousands of similar lava flows. There is also at least one layer cutting diagonally across the stack of lava flows. This is an intrusion of magma, most likely a feeder to some of the uppermost lava flows. However, this HiRISE image indicates that such intrusions make up only a minor part of the upper section of the volcano.
PSP_007961_2530	This image was originally suggested by Ehsan Sanaei's high school astronomy club in Yazd, Iran. They write, "(We are interested in) exploring the impact region near the Northern Martian pole and observing the contrast between ice-covered and [non-ice covered] regions."<br><br>Mrs. Stoica's  9th grade class, at Tudor Vianu High-School of Computer Science, in Bucharest, Romania, helped to analyze the image by writing that "we observe a major crater, a small mountain chain, dunes  and a series of small valleys and crevasses which (contain) ice."<br><br>Indeed, this image shows part of the western rim of Korolev Crater, a prominent 80 kilometer diameter crater located in the Northern polar region. It was taken in northern spring and shows dark regions of dust and sediment and bright regions of ice and frost. At highest resolution both bright and dark areas of the surface are covered by polygonal fracture patterns. Although much of the ice has likely started to sublimate (change from a solid to a gas) in the darker regions, ice fills the fractures. <br>
PSP_007962_2635	There is a vast region of sand dunes at high northern latitudes on Mars. In the winter, a layer of carbon dioxide ice covers the dunes, and in the spring as the sun warms the ice it evaporates. This is a very active process, and sand dislodged from the crests of the dunes cascades down, forming dark streaks.<br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_007962_2635_cut.jpg'><strong>In the subimage</strong></a> falling material has kicked up a small cloud of dust. The color of the ice surrounding adjacent streaks of material suggests that dust has settled on the ice at the bottom after similar events.<br><br>Also discernible in this subimage are polygonal cracks in the ice on the dunes (the cracks disappear when the ice is gone).<br><br>
PSP_008011_1975	This image shows <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008011_1975_cut.jpg'><strong>a small rayed impact crater,</strong></a> about 160 meters (530 feet) in diameter, in the Tharsis region in the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Relatively recent impacts form rays of ejecta that spray out radially from the crater. In addition to relatively fine material, large boulders and smaller secondary craters are visible in the rays surrounding this crater.<br><br>Secondary craters are recognized by their shallow depths (in comparison to primary craters), irregular shapes, and appearance in clusters and linear chains.
PSP_008017_2020	This image shows a young impact crater in the northern part of Isidis Planitia. The crater is fresh enough to preserve some fine textures that are eroded around other craters.<br><br>The ejecta blanket of material thrown out of the crater is distinctly dark and rough, with many small boulders and rugged texture. To the south of the crater there is a wedge-shaped area with little ejected material. This may indicate that the impactor which formed this crater came from the south, since at moderate impact angles ejecta is preferentially thrown in the direction of motion of the impactor. <br><br>Eventually, a combination of erosion and mantling by dust will smooth and obscure the ejecta and cover over the crater, turning it into a shallow depression <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008017_2020_cut.jpg'><strong>like the others in this image.</strong></a> Reworking of the crater is already beginning, as shown by the network of fine ridges (wind-blown ripples) on the crater floor.
PSP_008060_1770	This observation was taken in Miyamoto Crater in southwest Meridiani, an area near the equator of Mars. This image is located to the east of one of the potential <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> landing sites and is near the contact between the hematite-bearing plains unit to the northeast (where the <a href='http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/'><strong>Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity</strong></a> is exploring) and the phyllosilicate-bearing unit to the southwest. <br><br>Aeolian (wind deposited) processes are active here, which are visible in dunes and ripples, most likely made of basaltic sand. The bedrock contains phyllosilicates (clay minerals), which form in the presence of water. Phyllosilicates have been detected in higher concentrations in other areas of Mars such as Mawrth Vallis and Nili Fossae, but detections of lesser abundance have been noticed in Meridiani as well.
PSP_008075_1590	This observation shows a portion of an approximately 30 kilometer diameter impact crater located to the south of Valles Marineris.<br><br>The image reveals that the central uplift inside the crater is a mixture of dark-toned and light-toned materials. Itís likely that some of the rocks in the center of the crater represent units at depth that we wouldnít otherwise see along the plains that surround the crater. The light-toned units in particular are not visible in the plains surrounding this crater so they could be material that is buried beneath the plains and only visible inside craters or other vertical exposures, such as those created by faults. <br><br>Some of the light-toned material appears angular and blocky, consistent with material that has been disrupted and uplifted by an explosion associated with the craterís formation. The reason why some material appears light-toned is unknown but could be due to a different composition than the darker-toned unit.<br><br>Many light-toned units seen elsewhere on Mars, including within Valles Marineris, are made of sulfates so there may be sulfate-rich rocks buried beneath the plains at this location and the formation of the crater exposed them. In any case, the distinct materials visible within impact craters suggest that the crust on Mars may contain many units of variable composition.
PSP_008082_1560	This observation shows a wrinkle ridge in Hesperia Planum. Hesperia Planum encompasses a region of over two million square kilometers (over 770,000 square miles) in the southern highlands of Mars. It is located northwest of the Hellas basin and adjacent to Tyrrhena Patera and contains abundant orthogonal and intersecting wrinkle ridges. <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are linear or arcuate positive relief landforms. They commonly have asymmetrical cross sectional profiles that exhibit a broad arch with a superposed hill or crenulated ridge. There is typically an offset in elevation on either side of the ridge.<br><br>These features have been identified on many other planets including the Moon, Venus, and Mercury. On Mars, they are up to hundreds of kilometers long, tens of kilometers wide, and have a relief of a few hundred meters.  <br><br>Wrinkle ridges are most commonly believed to form from horizontal compression or shortening of the crust due to faulting and are often found in volcanic plains.<br><br>This image may show evidence of a possible paleo-spring emerging from the wrinkle ridge. Paleo-springs may form along faulted surfaces or wrinkle ridges where fluid can leak out. Examples of this are observed on Earth along faults. 
PSP_008100_1790	This image shows rocks on the floor of Iani Chaos, a region of collapsed and disorganized terrain.<br><br>The chaotic terrains on Mars may have been the sources of floodwaters that carved the giant outflow channels. They typically contain irregular hills like the one <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_008100_008199/PSP_8100_1790/PSP_ 8100_1790_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>in the center of this image.</strong></a> In some cases, they also have light-toned rocks exposed on the floors. The point of interest is to determine whether these rocks predate the chaos or formed after the collapse; however, the contacts may be obscured by later material mantling the ground. <br><br>The rocks here are light-toned, and have dark low patches which are likely a thin cover of wind-blown sand. At a coarse scale, linear features are also visible in the rock, likely reflecting <a href='/science_themes/aeolian.php'><strong>aeolian (wind) erosion</strong></a> in a preferred direction. A variety of processes could have contributed to forming these rocks, from volcanic eruptions to lake deposition or accumulation of wind-blown sand.<br><br>Stepped layers occur in places, suggesting a repetitive process. This argues for an origin as aeolian or lake-bed sediments, since volcanic eruptions may be of variable strength.
PSP_008144_2055	Slope streaks are features commonly found throughout the equatorial regions of Mars, particularly in areas where there is a great amount of dust accumulation. One such place is the Olympus Mons Aureole deposits that cover the ground beyond the northern flanks of the volcano.<br><br>This image shows many dark streaks that have formed along the slopes of the aureole deposits. Slope streaks appear dark after their formation and gradually fade over time. The fading is thought to occur by mantling of bright dust on their surfaces.<br><br>In this image, many streaks that are no longer dark appear to have topographic relief. You can often find them along slopes that are partially or fully shadowed, or those that are facing away from the sun. Although the processes involved in slope streak formation are still being debated in the scientific community, the topographic relief indicates that material must have been moved, or removed, when the streak formed. One such way for this to happen is dry avalanching of dusty and/or sandy materials.
PSP_008189_2080	This image features a series of long and somewhat linear ridges in the Huo Hsing Vallis region of Mars.<br><br>These ridges appear to be forming as a result of erosion of the surrounding rock. The ridges themselves are likely stronger that the surrounding rock and therefore stay behind as the remainder of the rock is whittled away, possibly by flowing water, blowing wind or a combination of both.<br><br>If water played a role in the erosion of the rock and exposure of these ridges, this water would have flowed many thousands or millions of years ago, perhaps through Huo Hsing Vallis. Water underground may also have helped to form these ridges prior to erosion. On Earth, water and other fluids flowing underground often follow cracks and faults, since it is easier for the liquids to flow through the open spaces of these fractures than through solid rock. These liquids often leave behind minerals within the fractures that help to strengthen the surrounding rock by essentially gluing the fragments of rock together. This can make the fracture stronger than the surrounding rock and lead to ridges that withstand the forces of erosion.<br><br>Similar ìcementedî fractures have also been interpreted elsewhere on Mars, and if true, would be useful indicators of the presence of underground water at some point in the planetís past.
PSP_008193_1535	Alluvial fans are deposits of sand, gravel, and sometimes boulders that were eroded from steep slopes (mountain fronts or basin walls) and deposited on plains at the base of the slope.<br><br>Erosion of deep alcoves into the walls of Holden Crater (155 kilometer diameter) provided sediment to these alluvial fans, which have coalesced into a large deposit called a bajada.  Most Martian impact craters that contain large alluvial fans are clustered between 18 degrees and 29 degrees South, and the Holden bajada is the largest of these deposits recognized to date.<br><br>Inverted channels are found on the alluvial fans, where the old stream beds were more resistant to later wind erosion than the fine-grained sediment deposited outside the channels, so preferential erosion of the fine materials left the channel beds exposed as ridges. Many ripples of more recent, wind-blown sand are found between the older inverted channels.<br><br>The <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> would land on the bajada and drive across the traversable ripples to the south, where the inverted channels, layers, and evidence for past fluvial activity are located. 
PSP_008208_2600	This image captures unusual arrow-shaped sand dunes in the north polar Olympia Undae region that may have been formed by changing winds. The dark patches and streaks show sand that has begun escaping from a blanket of seasonal frost.<br><br>Many of the typical types of Martian dunes are similar to common dunes on Earth. <strong>Transverse </strong> dunes have gentle upwind slopes and steep lee sides that are perpendicular to the wind direction. <strong>Barchans</strong> are crescent-shaped dunes with a gentle upwind slope and steep lee with horns. Other common dunes on Earth and Mars are <strong>seif</strong> dunes that form sinuous parallel ridges with bi-directional winds forming the slip-faces.<br><br>The dune types in this image transition from transverse in the south through tight chains of barchans, to the strange, elongated dunes in the north. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008208_2600_cut_a.jpg'><strong>These elongated dunes</strong></a> appear to be modified barchans with two slip-faces and asymmetric horns. The drawn out limbs and remnant slip-faces were apparently produced by variations in the wind direction. The winds that created the transverse dunes blow from a single easterly direction, while the modified barchans are shaped by winds from an easterly-northeasterly direction. The elongated horns align parallel to northeasterly winds. These wind variations could be caused by local topography.<br><br>Two factors likely contribute to the unique morphology of these dunes. First, the southern horns defrost sooner than the northern horns because they receive sunlight more directly. This enables material to move more easily on their southern side. Second, the changing wind directions may be reorienting the dunes. One idea is that the barchansí southern horns are being blown downwind into linear (seif-like) dunes, with sinuous crests and steep flanks. Another possible explanation is that they are drifts of sand (<strong>lee</strong> dunes) that form in the lee of an obstacle. The frozen barchans might act as obstacles to the wind, allowing loose sand to accumulate in their lee. In either case, the interaction between the sand, wind, and seasonal frost  <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008208_2600_cut_b.jpg'><strong>sculpts the dunes</a></strong> to their unusual,  arrow-like appearance.
PSP_008233_1920	This image shows a fan of material deposited on the floor of a large impact crater.<br><br>The material was transported into the crater through a valley, likely by running water. The end of the valley is <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_008200_008299/PSP_008233_1920/PSP_ 008233_1920_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>visible in the west (left) part of the image.</strong></a> Arcuate steps visible in the east are probably due to layers of different strength or cohesion; these suggest variations in the flow conditions.<br><br>A faint trough is carved into the upper surface of the fan. This could have been cut by the last water to flow across the surface. If the channel was flowing into a lake, this might indicate a drop in lake level, leading to erosion. <br><br>The surface of the fan has many small dark spots, particularly on the upper tier. The largest spots, most commonly around impact craters, are big enough to show that these are boulders. If these boulders are original and not due to the hardening of fan sediments into rock, it suggests that the flows which deposited the fan were relatively energetic events able to carry rocks across several feet.
PSP_008244_2645	The north polar layered deposits of Mars form a layered stack of dusty ice up to 3 kilometers (2 miles) thick. The differences from layer to layer are thought to reflect differences in the climate of Mars that existed when the layers were formed.<br><br>We can see these internal layers exposed on the faces of the many troughs and scarps that cut through these deposits. One of these scarp faces is shown here; it is situated at the head of a large canyon (named Chasma Boreale) that cuts through these polar<br>layered deposits.<br><br>The terrain on the right is higher and consists of the upper surface of the icy layered deposits in this area while the terrain on the left is lower and consists of the rocky ground that underlies the layered deposits. The cliff that separates these two areas runs down the center of the image with a relief of about 700 meters (about 2300 feet).<br><br>The section of the layered deposits that is exposed on this cliff face is unusual in that, as well layers of dusty ice, there are also layers of sand present. Small structures, called cross-beds, visible in the sandy layers indicate that each layer was originally a dune field that only later became covered with ice. Some of this sandy material is being removed from the cliff face and is forming new dunes at the foot of the cliff.
PSP_008265_1860	This image shows the head of a small, dry channel in Elysium Planitia, which is a low-lying area north of Marsí equator.<br><br>The channel is part of a larger network of interconnected channels and holding basins that crisscross the region. Although the channels were probably carved by floodwaters released from a fissure at the head of Athabasca Valles, they are now coated by solidified lava. This lava is readily visible <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_008200_008299/PSP_008265_1860/PSP_ 008265_1860_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>in the southwestern half</strong></a> of the image.<br><br>For the most part, it has a rough texture with jagged ridges and rafted plates. Its surface is lightly cratered, indicating that the flow is young. (Contrast this with the cratered plains in the northeastern part of the image.) The margins of the lava flow are lobate and slightly raised with respect to the cratered plains they embay.<br><br>The surface texture near the margins is polygonal but relatively smooth. Small crater- and cone-shaped landforms dot the edge of the flow in some places. These ìpseudocratersî or ìrootless conesî formed when the lava heated underlying groundwater to the point that it vented in steam explosions.  Although the lava is most visible in the southwestern half of the image, it is also present in and around the small channel to the northwest; it can be seen on the banks as well as the floor, and pseudocraters (rootless cones) occur along terraces in the channel walls. This suggests that the lava filled the channel to overflowing and then receded before solidifying. The horseshoe-shaped cliff at the head of the channel is an erosional scarp called a cataract.
PSP_008301_2480	This image is one of many that have been taken over the <a href='http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu'><strong>Phoenix landing site.</strong></a>  The Phoenix lander launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida in August 2007 and will reach the surface of Mars on 25 May 2008. <br><br>One of the reasons this region of Mars was selected for the landing site is based on the overall lack of rocks that could prove hazardous to the lander. Among the many science goals, Phoenix will analyze the surface dust as well as dig into an ice-rich layer which is predicted to lie within inches of the Martian surface. <br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008301_2480_cut_a.jpg'><strong>The polygons</strong></a> are most likely the result of temperature oscillations which cause this ice to crack resulting in the surface that is visible today.
PSP_008311_1835	This image is from Aram Chaos, a large crater connected to the Ares Vallis outflow channel. It is called ìchaosî because of the rough floor topography, large slumped blocks and large fractures that may have been caused by removal of subsurface material.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008311_1835_cut.jpg'><strong>The subimage is a false-color one,</strong></a> and the lighter-toned area is a heavily fluted and pitted capping unit. This surface tends to trap dark sand (which appears blue in false color) in the lows. The dark blue sand can also be seen to form dunes below the cliff.<br><br>Sulfates have been detected in the cliff walls in some areas within Aram Chaos, as well as hematite. It has been suggested that these materials were deposited within a lake setting.
PSP_008322_1865	This image is of a crater in Arabia Terra, which is a large swath of bright (high albedo) terrain in the Martian cratered uplands.  The steep interior walls of the crater are covered with numerous slope streaks, thought to be caused by dust avalanches that strip away layers of dust to reveal a darker underlying surface.<br><br>Here, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008322_1865_cut.jpg'><strong>multiple generations of slope streaks</strong></a> are present. The most recent features appear the darkest, and they appear to gradually brighten over time as more dust is deposited from the thin Martian atmosphere. Causes of dust avalanches include small impact craters, rockfalls, and oversteepening of the surface as dust accumulates. This last mechanism is similar to the way in which snow-covered slopes in high mountain areas on Earth accumulate enough snow to become gravitationally unstable, leading eventually to avalanches.<br>
PSP_008323_1735	This blocky terrain is southwest of Schiaparelli Crater and is surrounded by a field of Transverse Aeolian Ridges (TARs) and unusual star ripples (dunes).<br><br>TARs are linear ripples with crest-ridge morphologies that can vary in shape; these morphologies include forked, sinuous, barchanoid, networked or feathered characteristics. The ridges also appear to <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008323_1735_cut_a.jpg'><strong>transition into star dunes</strong></a>.<br><br>Star dunes are complex features and are not yet fully understood on Earth. They form by multidirectional wind regimes with a dominant primary wind. Chains of star dunes often appear to have a massive linear appearance, or can be modified linear or barchan dunes with the formation of secondary slipfaces (on the steeper slope). On Earth, there are incipient star dunes, such as in the Dumont dune field in the Mojave Desert, that <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008323_1735_cut_b.jpg'><strong>display similar characteristics</strong></a>. The Dumont embryonic star dunes may result from dunes merging as they overrun one another, or are modified preexisting dunes, which could also be the case in this image. <br><br>Martian weather models predict that the dominate wind comes from a southwesterly direction. This direction aligns nicely with the transverse ripples and the main arms of the star ripples. This suggests that the star ripples were also affected by a different wind pattern or secondary winds or airflow. (Secondary airflow is the airflow and sediment transport around the slopes of the dune.)<br><br>Formation of incipient star dunes depends on the nature (strength, direction, and duration) of the primary wind and the volume of the sand to create the dune. Secondary airflow maintains the dune arms. The last factor is the deposition or removal of the sand by grainfall or grainflow avalanching. Grainfall and grainflow transports material from the main crestline slipface and along-slope or down-slope which maintains the secondary arm crest.<br>

PSP_008338_1525	This observation reveals layered deposits on the floor of Uzboi Vallis. These deposits were emplaced when drainage along Uzboi was blocked by the formation of the rim of Holden Crater to the north.<br><br>Water ponding on the floor of the valley created a short-lived lake that eventually rose and overtopped Holdenís rim. As the Uzboi lake drained into Holden crater, water flowing along the floor of the valley eroded and exposed these layers.<br><br>The layers can be traced for considerable distances, but appear to erode into and/or consist of fairly coarse sediments. Hence, their emplacement may have been relatively rapid as compared to deposition in longer-lived lakes elsewhere on Mars (e.g., within Holden Crater)
PSP_008387_1510	This image shows an area within a depression at the northern inner rim of the Hellas impact basin. Prominent layers of rock are visible, expressed here as topographic benches and cliffs.<br><br>The layers exhibit various brightnesses (in the black and white image, from the HiRISE red filter) and colors (in the color RGB product). The geology of the Hellas basin is complex, with the original impact that formed the structure occurring more then four billion years ago. Since then, the basin has been modified by many processes, including volcanism, wind, water, and maybe glacial activity.<br><br>This makes it challenging, without further study, to know the origin of the layers seen here. However, some insight is gained simply by looking at the texture of the layers, which HiRISE can see with its high resolution. For example, many of the bright layers appear jointed; that is, they contain cracks in a regular, commonly polygonal, arrangement. Volcanic rocks can form such textures upon cooling, as can water-rich sediments upon drying.<br><br>Regular patterns of ripples are visible throughout the image, indicating pervasive wind activity. The <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008387_1510_cut.jpg'><strong>color sub-image</strong></a> shows two boulders that have rolled from the cliffs to the east. Bounce marks are also apparent between the boulders and cliffs. Because the bounce marks have not been filled in with dust or sand, the boulders must have rolled down the slope fairly recently.<br>

PSP_008391_1790	This image shows part of the floor of Orson Welles Crater, an old impact crater now connected with the Shalbatana Valles outflow channel. Part of the floor of the crater is comprised of large hummocks comparable to those found in other ìchaotic terrainî on Mars; such areas are often the sources of giant flood channels. <br><br>Examined closely, the light-toned areas consist of finely-layered materials, partially buried by dark mantling material and sand dunes. Such light-toned rocks are found at a number of sites on Mars and are thought to be sedimentary. Notable color variations occur in the rocks may be a result of  different compositions.<br><br>In addition to the varying light and dark bands, some of the rocks appear pale blue in the false color image while others have a yellowish tone. Another sign of variation in the rocks is the way some layers seem to form benches, while others have steep edges. This indicates that layers have different strengths, and that whatever process formed these rocks varied during deposition of the layers. <br><br>The origin of such light, layered rocks on Mars is still uncertain and probably variable. Some may be wind-deposited sandstone, like that at the MER Opportunity landing site while other outcrops could be volcanic ash like that at the MER Spirit landing site. Others may be  lakebed deposits. Unraveling the history of these rocks helps provide a window into events in the Martian past.<br>
PSP_008426_2595	The north polar region is surrounded by a large sea (erg) of dark sand dunes that become covered by seasonal carbon dioxide frost. As the northern hemisphere begins to warm in the spring, the frozen carbon dioxide sublimates. The wind blows from an east-northeasterly direction and leaves dark streaks behind (exposed basalt) from the evaporating carbon dioxide. This image displays defrosting sand dunes in an unnamed crater. <br><br>The dune morphology in this image is complex. Because of the presence of the ice, it is difficult to determine all of the dune types. These jumbled dunes may result from erosion of the layers within the crater walls that <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008426_2595_cut_a.jpg'><strong>act as a dune source.</strong></a>. However, two common types of dunes can be classified: the outer ring of the dune field is composed of chains of barchan dunes whereas the central area of the field contains transverse dunes. <br><br>Barchans are characterized by their crescent-shape with steep horns in the downwind direction. The transverse dunes have asymmetric, nearly parallel ridges and are oriented perpendicular to the wind direction. <br><br>Another feature of interest is the sublimating polygons that have <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008426_2595_cut_b.jpg'><strong>very small ripples on top of them.</strong></a> Polygons are created from a freeze-thaw processes similar to features on Earth that undergo annual contraction of the permafrost regolith.
PSP_008427_1380	It is now fall in the southern hemisphere and in the giant impact crater known as Hellas basin small boulders cast long shadows. The long shadows emphasize small scale topographic features.  Wind erosion is responsible for much of the morphology in this region.<br><br>Frost is condensing, and shows up as bright blue patches <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008427_1380_cut_a.jpg'><strong>in this false color image.</strong></a>  This is seasonal carbon dioxide frost.  Closer to the pole, carbon dioxide condenses from the atmosphere and forms a seasonal polar cap.

PSP_008437_1750	Gale Crater is approximately 150 kilometers in diameter and located near the dichotomy boundary between the Martian southern highlands and the northern lowlands.<br><br>The central mound of Gale Crater is of interest to scientists because it is composed of light-toned layered deposits that extend higher than the rim of the crater. The origin of the sediments making up the layers is unknown, but possible formations include deposition in an ancient flood or lake or the deposition of windblown particles such as dust or volcanic ash.<br><br>Wind erosion has been an active process in Gale, modifying the layered deposits by creating sharp edges, a scalloped texture, and rounded depressions. This image is located on the northeastern part of the central mound inside the crater.<br>
PSP_008452_2175	This image shows features from Utopia Planitia, part of the broad northern plains of Mars. Much research has focused on possible ice-related geomorphology in this area, which contains many peculiar landforms. <br><br>In this image, the prominent features are fractured mounds or hills. Many of these seem partially to fill small impact craters, but some are found on level ground. These could be landforms produced by ground ice upheaval, or perhaps eroded remnants of some kind of mantling layer. Recent research indicates that some of these landforms occur only at certain latitudes and thus certain climate conditions, suggesting a possible role for ice in their formation. <br><br>The level surface also has an intriguing pitted appearance, with some variations across the image. This might also have been produced by the sublimation (going from a solid directly to a gas) of ice in the upper soil. The surface, including the mounds, has ubiquitous small boulders, only a few HiRISE pixels across. The presence of boulders indicates that this surface material does not consist only of very fine sediments, as might have been expected in a deep ocean basin. Whatever process deposited the upper sediments on these northern plains must have carried boulders up to about one meter diameter. <br>
PSP_008508_1870	This image shows part of the margin of a pedestal crater. A pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta standing above the surrounding terrain. These form when an impact crater ejects material which forms a resistant layer. This resistant blanket coats material around the crater, which is thus eroded more slowly than the rest of the region. The result is that both the crater and its ejecta blanket stand above the surroundings. <br><br>At this site, only a small part of the edge of the ejecta is visible. The ejecta is eroding, leaving a ragged edge with some detached mesas and buttes. The uppermost layer in the small cliffs is clearly strong and erosion-resistant, as it forms steep and even overhanging edges, ultimately breaking up into boulders which fall down the slopes. This layer armors the underlying material against erosion. Sites like this offer the opportunity to study units of rock that otherwise might have been erased by erosion.
PSP_008523_2060	Kasei Valles is a system of very large channels that were carved into Lunae Planum by one or more large catastrophic floods. These channels split and merge at various points, and ultimately terminate at Chryse Planitia. This image was taken in the southeastern portion of the channel system, near Wassamu Crater.<br><br>This observation shows some smaller channels that have been carved into the floor of one branch of the channel. This set of sub-channels originates at the front of one of the streamline islands within the system. The largest channels in the Kasei Valles system can be up to 500 kilometers (300 miles) wide, whereas these smaller incisions are only about 500 meters (0.3 miles) wide. These smaller channels may have formed by later fluid flow after the major flooding events, further cutting into the channel floor. <br><br>This region is very dusty, and dust streaks can be seen covering the flat mesas. Within the channels large dunes of dust have formed from winds blowing through the channels.  On the steeps slopes of the dunes <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008523_2060_cut.jpg'><strong>are a smaller set of ripples</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_008548_2205	This image shows bright mounds scattered throughout a rather flat, dark landscape. These mounds range approximately between 20 and 500 meters (yards) in diameter.<br><br>The largest among them show central crater-like depressions which give them an appearance similar to terrestrial volcanoes. The origin of these mounds is still unclear. The most widely accepted hypotheses involve extrusion of underlying fluid-like materials (lava, wet/icy sediments) through weak points in the surface. <br><br>Similar mounds have been observed elsewhere in the <br><a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/mission/images/PIA02820_mola.jpg'>Northern Lowlands</a>. (The Northern Lowlands encompass a vast region of Mars younger than the rest of the planet, as shown by lower number of impact craters, and well below its average altitude.) Mounds such as the ones shown in this image may hold important clues for scientist to decipher the history of the Northern Lowlands: an old ocean basin? The site of continental-scale volcanism? Detailed analysis of HiRISE and other complementary datasets will help solve this mystery.<br>
PSP_008559_1405	Hellas Basin is the largest known impact crater on the surface of Mars (approximately 2100 kilometers in diameter) and the second largest in the solar system to only the Moonís South-Pole Aitken Basin.<br><br>The basin is located in in the southern highlands of Mars and is thought to have been formed very early in Mars geologic history during the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 3.9 billion years ago. Each new observation of this impact basin has increased our understanding of the regionís geologic complexity.  <br><br>The region in this image is an example of what is known as complex banded terrain (also known colloquially as ìtaffy-pullî terrain) in the Northwest portion of Hellas Planitia. Its process of formation is still largely unknown, although it appears to be due to erosion of hard and soft sediment layers. However, this does nothing to explain the complex flow patterns that seem to be the result of ductile deformation.  Ductile deformation results from layers undergoing strain, or deformation, due to large external stresses.<br>
PSP_008561_2205	This image shows a scene from the northern plains of Mars, near the edge of the lowland known as Acidalia Planitia.<br><br>Several features common to the area are visible. Most striking are the circular, pancake-shaped domes with pits or craters at the summit. These were once thought to be volcanic features, but recent research suggests that these are instead mud volcanoes. On Earth, mud volcanoes form when wet sediment is overpressured and squeezed out onto the surface. In many cases, these domes have finely fractured surfaces, which could be due to either desiccation (loss of water) or temperature changes in the ice. <br><br>The domes at this side are similar in color to the surrounding material, appearing as blue <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_008500_008599/PSP_008561_2205/PSP_008561_2205_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>in HiRISE false color.</strong></a> However, this may be due to a thin coating of dust, as an impact crater in the color swath appears to expose material of a different color. <br><br>The image includes some large troughs, up to hundreds of meters wide. These are also widespread in the area, forming crudely polygonal patterns on a multi-kilometer scale. These are distinct from the small polygons like those at the Phoenix landing site, which form by thermal cycling in ground ice; the origin of these giant polygons is still a subject of ongoing research. <br>
PSP_008571_1995	Nili Fossae is a region that is thought to be approximately 3.5 billion years in age and, based on results from Omega, is the largest exposure of olivine (a common dark colored rock forming mineral found in igneous rocks) on the surface of Mars. The many fractures and grabens (depressed blocks of crust resulting from extension) that make up the region are believed to be the result of the Isidis impact basin.<br><br>Of particular interest are the two impact clusters found midway down this image. Each cluster is approximately 100 meters in diameter. The exact origin of such features is not known. It is thought that they are the result of a loosely conglomerated, stony meteoroid that broke apart during descent through the Martian atmosphere.<br>
PSP_008579_9020	MRO's HiRISE camera acquired <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_cut.jpg'><strong>this dramatic oblique image</strong></a> of Phoenix descending on its parachute.  Shown here is a a wider view of the full image, showing a 10 kilometer diameter crater informally called "Heimdall" and an improved full-resolution image of the parachute and lander. <br><br>Although it appears that Phoenix is descending into the crater, it is actually about 20 kilometers in front of the crater. It is difficult to believe that it is in front of the crater because it is so much smaller, but in reality it is, and that's a good thing because landing on the steep rocky slopes of the crater would have been far too exciting (or risky). <br><br>Images from the lander clearly show that it sits on a flat plain, although the rim of Heimdall may be visible on the horizon. Given the position and pointing angle of MRO, Phoenix is at about 13 km above the surface, just a few seconds after the parachute opened. This improved image shows some details of the parachute, including the gap between upper and lower sections. At the time of this observation, MRO had an orbital altitude of 310 km, traveling at a ground velocity of 3.4 kilometers/second, and a distance of 760 km to the Phoenix lander. <br><br>The image was rotated to a position that seems approximately parallel to the horizon based on the elongation of Heimdall crater, but this is not exact.  Thus, although Phoenix appears to hang from the parachute at an angle, as if swaying in the wind, the exact geometry has not yet been determined.  The parachute image is very sharp as its apparent motion was straight down the HiRISE TDI (time delay integration) columns.  However, the surface of Mars was moving at an angle to the TDI columns, and thus is smeared by a few pixels, although the smear is not apparent at the reduced scale of the image shown here.<br><br><strong>SCALE INFORMATION</strong><br>Map projected scale: No map projected products<br>Original image scale range: 0.792712 cm/pixel <br><br><strong>UNANNOTATED IMAGES</strong><br>For those interested in larger, unannotated versions, you may select a TIF image here:<br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_2048sx1019.tif'><strong>PSP_008579_9020 (2048 samples x 1019 lines; 4MB)</strong></a><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_4096sx2038l.tif'><strong>PSP_008579_9020 (4096 samples x 2038 lines; 16MB.)</strong></a> <br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_Fullres_Inset.tif'><strong>PSP_008579_9020 Parachute insert (756KB)</strong></a><br><br><strong>TIFF WITH INSET</strong><br>A TIFF version of the descent image with its inset is <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_descent.tif'><strong>PSP_008579_9020_descent</strong></a> (4096x2038; 24 MB)<br><br><strong>ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS AND COLOR</strong><br>HiRISE has managed to produce a version of this image <a href='phoenix-descent-color.php'><strong>with a color swath</strong></a>. <br><br><strong>*NOTE ON NOMENCLATURE</strong><br>When this caption was written, the name "Heimdall" (with the double "L") was an informal one.

We decided to keep the original spelling in the caption as part of the historical moment of this incredible image.<br>
PSP_008579_9020-B	HiRISE acquired this <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/phoenix-descent.php'><strong>now famous image</strong></a> of the Phoenix Lander during its descent through the atmosphere. The lander was still inside the backshell hanging from its parachute at the moment this image was taken. It was an engineering triumph to capture the lander within the HiRISE field of view. We had hoped for it to be within the color portion of the HiRISE camera, but unfortunately it missed that area.<br><br>For this reason, processing the color bands did not take a high priority in the days following acquisition of this image. The unusual geometry of the image prevented the color processing from running through the automated software pipelines. It had to be processed "by hand" which means processing parameters were adjusting manually until good registration of the color bands was achieved.<br><br>Normally, the 10 CCDs that span the HiRISE image area overlap by 48 pixels at their edges. The gaps in the image are due to the fact that Mars surface was moving through the HiRISE field of view at an angle, which also caused some image smear.  (The slew was designed to get an unsmeared image of the parachute.) Some CCDs have gaps between them, while others overlap more than usual. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_cut_c.jpg'><strong>Map projection takes the image</strong></a> and transforms it so it looks like you are looking straight down at the surface. The lander is very distorted in the map projection, because it is not actually on the surface.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020_cut_b.jpg'><strong>In the non-map projected image,</strong></a> the gaps have been closed to make a more aesthetic image. Some discontinuities are visible along the seams between CCDs where this has been done.<br><br>The color does give some more information about the crater. There is frost or ice in the bowl of the crater which shows up as blue in the false color HiRISE data. Here the color has been adjusted for a more natural appearance. The frost is visible in the right side of the non-projected image.<br><br>The Phoenix Lander discarded its heat shield after deploying the parachute. Scientists and engineers at JPL believe that the heat shield should also be visible in this image. After some analysis, the <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008579_9020-B_cut_a.jpg'><strong>small dark dot located below the lander</strong></a> looks like a stong candidate for the heat shield. It is in the right location based on descent trajectories and timing. <br><br>Another sign that the small dark spot is the heat shield is that its pixel value is lower than any other dark spot in the vicinity. The lander is approximately 20 kilometers in front of the crater, so there is at least 20 km less atmosphere between the HiRISE camera and the lander and heat shield than between the camera and the surface. The size is right, too. The heat shield protected the bottom of the lander through atmospheric entry, so its external surface would be a charred black. It is visible in the images taken of the actual <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/phoenix-hardware_11.php'>landing site</a>.<br>
PSP_008585_2915	MRO's HiRISE camera acquired this image of the Phoenix landing site 11 hours after landing.

PSP_008598_2155	This image shows lineated valley fill in the Coloe Fossae region of Mars.<br><br>This region consists of several relatively straight and narrow canyons located near the boundary between the high-standing, heavily cratered areas of the southern hemisphere and the low, uncratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere of Mars. Transitional areas such as this are known as the ìfretted terrainî and are characterized by a complicated mix of cliffs, mesas, buttes, and canyons. <br><br>This image reveals a canyon with relatively steep and smooth walls. The floor of the canyon displays a complex set of ridges and grooves that are generally parallel to the canyon walls. The material comprising the canyon floor is common observed in fretted terrain and is called lineated valley fill. The cause of the lineated valley fill texture is not well understood but may result from patterns of ice rich soils or ice loss. The linear alignment may be caused by the downhill movement of ice-rich soil, or glacial flow in dirty ice or ice-rich soil.<br>
PSP_008641_2105	This image was taken of a region in Chryse Planitia where Tiu, Ares, and Kasei Valles end.  This relatively flat region is pockmarked by impact craters large and small. <br><br>This image contains the side of one crater that is about 5 kilometers in diameter, several closer to 1 km, and many that are smaller than 100 meters.  In the large 5 km crater, layers of rock are exposed in the crater wall.  This is not surprising, given that Tiu, Ares and Kasei Valles all probably dumped tremendous amounts of sediments here, and each of the layers may represent sedimentary layers.  Rays of ejecta are observed in radiating out from the large crater. There is also a younger small crater about half-way down, on the right side of the image that has dark ejecta rays still preserved on the surface.<br><br>Pit crater chains, in contrast, are not formed by impacts, but by the collapse of material into a void. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008641_2105_cut.jpg'><strong> In the center of the image</strong></a> is a pit crater chain along the linear feature.  This linear feature is a graben, which is a block that had dropped down between two parallel faults.  Pit chains commonly form in grabens, where there is collapse of material into the subsurface void.  This is because this is an area of extension, or pulling apart of the crust.  Pit crater chains are also observed associated with lava tubes in other locations on Mars.  So these holes in the ground are distinctly different from the craters caused by impacts visible in the rest of the image.<br>

PSP_008681_2550	The Vastitas Borealis region, or northern lowlands, is a large area of low-lying surface that surrounds Mars&rsquo; North Pole.<br><br>On average, the region is 4-5 kilometers lower in elevation than the mean radius of the planet. How this basin formed is not known, although researchers have postulated that it could have been the result of a very large-scale impact sometime in Mars&rsquo; distant past. As of this writing, it is summer in the Martian northern hemisphere, allowing the HiRISE camera to image this region in full sunlight.<br><br>The sinuous landforms are dunes composed of sand that is made of basalt (a volcanic rock) or gypsum (a hydrous sulfate). There is a transition of modified barchanoid (crescent shaped dunes, generally wider than they are long) and transverse chains into star dunes; the winds change a lot in this area. The orientation of the barchanoid and transverse dunes indicate that the winds that formed them blow from the east (right side of image). In some areas there are a few linear dunes.  The light-toned, smaller bedforms are designated transverse aeolian ridges (TARs). <br>
PSP_008708_1780	Many of the troughs of Valles Marineris contain mounds composed of light-toned layered deposits. Scientists have been debating both the origin of these layered deposits and their age of deposition relative to the troughs. <br><br>Some scientists think that the layered deposits formed first and then were covered by lava flows that make up the plains. Later, formation of the troughs of Valles Marineris created large openings through the plains that exposed the buried layered deposits. Others have argued that the light-toned layered deposits formed after the troughs and filled up portions of the canyons. <br><br>The chaotic terrain in Juventae is believed to have formed when subsurface water in the ground flowed away, causing collapse of the ground and leaving behind numerous hills along the floor of the trough.<br><br>In this HiRISE image, the geologic contacts between the wallrock (darker units at the top of the image), light-toned layered deposits, and darker hills of the chaotic terrain are visible. By studying the image, scientists hope to determine what are the relative ages of these different units in order to decipher the geologic history of this region. A stereo image of this location could be even more helpful because it will show the three-dimensional relationships between the different units, thus revealing more information about their relative ages.<br>
PSP_008710_1710	This image shows a relatively dark lava flow on the Tharsis volcanic plains, east of Arsia Mons.<br><br>The entire region is composed of a thick stack of volcanic flows. The lava flow in the northern part of the image is distinctly darker than its surroundings, which are buried under a layer of dust. <br><br>Most of the image has a fluffy, blurry texture. This is the mantle of dust or volcanic ash that commonly coats volcanic regions on Mars. The dark flow is buried by this material along its southeastern boundary; it appears that the mantle is being stripped off of the flow surface. Perhaps this flow is somewhat smooth at a fine scale and traps relatively little dust. <br><br>This flow is probably young. The western edge of the dark region does appear to be the edge of the lava flow, indicating that this flow is relatively high-standing. This could make it more exposed to the wind and allow the mantle to be stripped.
PSP_008753_1880	Elysium Planitia is a part of the Martian lowlands that has been repeatedly covered by vast floods of lava. This image shows an older impact crater that has been filled by one of the youngest of those lava floods.<br><br>Only sections of the circular rim of the crater remain uncovered. The lava surface consists of ridged plates that have rafted apart with smoother lava filling between the plates. The ridges formed as the solidifying lava crust was crumpled by compression, and the gaps between the plates formed as the crust was pulled apart. Similar compression and extension of lava crust has been observed in the largest lava flows in Iceland.  <br><br>The most puzzling aspect of this image is that the lava in the floor of the crater appears to have sunk down compared to its surroundings. This happened after a thick crust had formed on the lava. The most likely explanation is that the last molten lava inside the flow drained away through a now buried gap in the crater rim.  <br><br>A final point of interest are the small circular cones visible near the center of the crater.  These formed when ground water (or ice) was turned to steam by the heat of the lava flow.  This steam exploded through the flow, producing the small cratered cones. 
PSP_008767_2055	Cone-shaped hills with summit depressions or craters similar to the two examples in this image are common in the northern mid-latitudes of Mars. Their occurrence in plains that are likely to be volcanic in origin, and their shape that is similar to small explosive cones on Earth, are evidence for a volcanic genesis of these cones. <br><br>But the details of the surrounding area and the cones, in this case, demonstrate they are too battered by small impact craters and erosion in general to allow a definitive interpretation. They could also be simply erosional outliers of an older terrain. Or, they may be non-volcanic features similar to certain ice-related hills on Earth.<br>
PSP_008774_1755	This image captures inverted streams and a light-toned layered deposit on the plains adjacent to Juventae Chasma.<br><br>A dark-toned mantling unit covers much of the light-toned layered deposit, limiting the amount of exposed strata. The exposed layers within these deposits have variations in brightness, color, and erosional properties. Light-toned layered deposits within Juventae do not have these variations. The layering and inverted streams may have once extended further to the east but have been destroyed by continued expansion of Juventae Chasma. <br><br>The image also shows that the inverted streams contain light-toned layering. The inverted streams could have formed when less resistant material surrounding the channels differentially eroded to expose the layered sediment that once flowed through the channels. The sediment within the former streams likely became more resistant due to cementation by late fluid circulation.<br>
PSP_008778_1685	This image was targeted because a previous <a href='http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/mgs_moc_archive.html'><strong>MOC image</strong></a> (R1100035) showed a distinctive field of mounds on the floor of an ancient, large, filled-in crater.<br><br>The origin of the mounds was unclear, so we hoped that a HiRISE image with higher resolution and color would solve the mystery. The HiRISE image shows much more detail on the mounds and other rough textures, indicating that this is an eroded bedrock surface, perhaps exposed by removal of an overlying layer of fine-grained materials by the wind.<br><br>But how did the rocks form, and why did they erode onto mounds?  It could have been lava or impact ejecta or fluvial sediments, perhaps altered and indurated by groundwater. The mounds could be due to how it was depositedólike hummocky impact ejectaóor how it was indurated. In other words, we haven't solved the mystery!  <br><br>Yet we may get new clues from future images of similar terrains in places where the origin is more interpretable, or from other datasets such as the mineral content determined by <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM.</strong></a>
PSP_008779_1905	This observation is located at the head of the Athabasca Valles channel system, which lies just north of Marsí equator in a low-elevation region known as Elysium Planitia. <br><br>Athabasca Valles has an interesting geologic history. It was probably carved by one or more catastrophic floods of water, but more recently, a flood of lava coursed through the channel system. Both the water and the lava erupted from a few discrete points (or ìventsî) along the Cerberus Fossae, a 1600-kilometer (1000-mile) long network of extensional (or ìnormalî) faults.  The two prominent troughs that cut across the southern end of this HiRISE image are part of the Cerberus Fossae.  They are distinct fault segments that overlap at their tips, as one tapers in and the other pinches out.  <br><br>They were not always as wide as they are today. Erosional processes have widened the troughs over time. Major eruptions occurred along both of the fault segments seen in this image, though they occurred to either side of the imaged area itself. Lava that erupted from the western vent covers the northern half of the image.  The lava has raised, lobate margins and is slightly darker in tone than the older cratered plains it embays. The lava also has a banded appearance of subtly contrasting lighter and darker tones, that correspond to variations in surface roughness. The bands are concentric to a vent located immediately west of the imaged area.  Unfortunately, vents along the Cerberus Fossae are not well preserved.<br>
PSP_008792_1410	This approximately 8 kilometer-diameter impact crater is interesting because of the light-toned band visible in the upper slopes of the inner crater wall.<br><br>Because the  light-toned materials are confined to a distinct elevation within the crater, it is possible that it represents a well-defined layer exposed in the crater walls. <br>
PSP_008829_1735	This observation shows an area southwest of Tharsis Montes, where some of the largest volcanoes of Mars are located.<br><br>The image looks very flat and homogeneous; some parts of it may even appear out-of-focus at first. However, sharper-looking features such as the crater and the <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008829_1735_cut.jpg'><strong>long landslide scars</strong></a> (250 x 375 meters, or 270 x 410 yards; 1.5 Mb) show that the fuzzy look is not an artifact of the image, but rather indicative of an extremely smooth surface. That smoothness is due to a thick layer of dust blanketing the landscape.<br><br>How do we know this is dust? The lines of evidence below indicate that this is the case.<br><br>Surface temperature measurements performed from satellites orbiting Mars show that these materials get relatively warm during the day (when they are illuminated by the Sun) and very cold at night. Rocks or sand would not experiment such large temperature oscillations between day and night. That is, dust has lower <a href='http://lasp.colorado.edu/inertia/'><strong>thermal inertia</strong></a> than rocks and sand. <br><br>Also, dust is uniformly bright (light) in color. Fine-grained materials are generally lighter in color that their coarser-grained counterparts, because of the way light is scattered (bounced) by fine particles. Martian dust has consistently a very light, reddish color, characteristic of the oxidized (rusty) iron in it.<br><br>Another piece of evidence is that even though these materials are loose (<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008829_1735_cut.jpg'><strong>as shown by the landslides</strong></a>), they are not movable by wind (demonstrated by the lack of <a href='http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/'><strong>dunes</strong></a>. Wind does not move dust easily; stronger winds are needed to move dust alone than to move sand. This is because cohesive (sticky) forces between dust particles lock them into the surface.<br><br>On Mars, where the air is approximately 1,000 times thiner than on Earth, wind speeds on the order of 450-650 km/hour (280-400 miles/hour) would be required to move pure dust. If dust was mixed with sand, then it would be easier for weaker winds to move the dust particles, by hitting them with sand grains and thus lofting the dust into the air.
PSP_008839_2575	At high northern latitudes, shallow troughs in the ice-rich ground form polygonal patterns. The polygons form over many years as the near-surface ice contracts and expands seasonally. <br><br>On top of this patterned ground in this image are dunes. Loose sand and dust are blown across the hard-cemented surface until collecting and forming a dune. Streaks of dust are visible <a href=images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008839_2575_cut.jpg><strong>in this color subimage</strong></a> coming from the horns of the dunes, while the higher portion of the dune blocks the dust from being blown across the surface. <br><br>Small ripples are also visible, and the small bright spots are the remnants of the seasonal carbon dioxide polar cap that coats this area in the winter.  <br>
PSP_008842_1705	This image is centered on the vent area of a small shield volcano located within the summit caldera of Arsia Mons, the southernmost of the large three Tharsis Montes volcanoes.<br><br>Since the first details of the volcano were revealed  by the Viking orbiters 30 years ago, the presence of a string of several small shield volcanoes across the floor of the caldera has been known. The resolution of the Viking images was insufficient to show more than the mere presence of small shield volcanoes and the fact that they appeared to line up along a linear trend across the floor. And, it was suspected that the small shield volcanoes were the source of the lava flows that appeared to cover the floor of the caldera, but details have been elusive.<br> <br>This HiRISE image of the central small shield volcano on the caldera floor shows that there are numerous lava flows radiating from a small summit crater. To the north and south, the lavas have accumulated in lobes, some of which radiate smaller channels and lobes. About midway from the crater, to both the top and bottom of the image, the surface appears very smooth and there are few details visible. Until detailed geologic mapping is done, it is difficult to conclude whether these smooth areas represent distal ponding of lavas that erupted from the summit crater of the small shield volcano, lava flows that have invaded from outside the image area at a time later than the formation of the small shield volcano, or later deposits of dust and ash that have simply covered the surface.<br><br>Whatever the relationships, it is clear that the floor of the largest caldera on Mars is far from a bland surface of old lava flows. Numerous flows and multiple vents have all interacted to create a complex series of surfaces that record the geologic development of the caldera floor.<br>
PSP_008855_2485	As the Phoenix Lander investigates the Martian surface, HiRISE continues to image it and its surroundings. This scene is oriented with north located approximately down.  Illumination is from the upper right.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008855_2485_cut.jpg'><strong>The false color subimage</strong></a> features three main pieces of hardware.  The parachute attached by strings to the backshell is located at the top. To the lower left of the parachute is a large dark splotch and a smaller dark dot.  The dark dot is the heat shield that protected the Phoenix Lander during its descent.  The dark splotch probably formed where the heat shield first hit the surface.  The lander itself is seen near the bottom.  The solar panels are seen to extend approximately east-west.  It is important to check that they extended fully after landing because they are responsible for powering Phoenix and its science operations.  The darkness of the surface surrounding the lander is a result of the thrusters disturbing the soil as Phoenix descended.  <br>
PSP_008869_1615	This observation shows the details of the distal end of a lava flow that likely started at the flank of Arsia Mons, several hundred kilometers away. Lava flows are abundant in the region south and west of Arsia Mons and most of them appear like runny wax, especially in images that cover large areas at low resolutions. <br><br>But this HiRISE image shows that while many features of lava flows occur on the older lava flows, the surfaces have also been smoothed over in many places by mobile, fine-grained materials. Later flows like that in the top third of this image appear much rougher. Up close, even younger lava flows have their share of mantling materials deposited on their surfaces.<br><br>This image also shows how lava flows advanced by sprouting small fingers and toes of lava along their margins. These in turn become the pathways for more lavas and eventual  accumulations that spread over these toes and fingers. Most of the surface of the lava flow appears to be a complex in some places, and in others, patterned ridges formed during complex jostling of the brittle and solid crust that formed on the lava flow even as it was still moving.<br><br>In the southern half of this image there are several areas of aligned pits and channels. These are probably the expressions of collapsed lava tubes that originally fed these earlier lava flows. So even older lava flows still preserve details of how lava flows are emplaced during eruptions.
PSP_008927_2010	Nili Fossae trough is a linear trough about 25 kilometers wide, formed in response to the creation of the Isidis basin.<br><br>Nili Fossae has diverse deposits, some containing phyllosilicates (clay deposits which typically form in the presence of water), and others with the minerals olivine and pyroxene.<br><br>This image is part of a series covering the 25 km landing ellipse; these images are used to determine the safest possible landing site for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory rover</strong></a>. In this image, relatively smooth rock exposures is visible, as well as sand ripples and some small knobs. There are few large rocks in the area, while the surface seems to be mostly flat, fractured rock. This image is located in the southeastern part of the landing ellipse.
PSP_008930_1880	This image shows layered sedimentary rocks that fill an impact crater in the Meridiani Planum region of Mars. <br><br>These layered rocks may have formed through the accumulation of sediment (sand and dust) that were transported into this crater by blowing wind or flowing water. These sediments formed an extensive deposit that once covered the floor of the surrounding impact crater. <br><br>This crater is so large that the HiRISE image is entirely within it, and the crater rim is not visible. These sedimentary rocks were then eroded, likely by the wind. The original sand and dust were deposited in distinct layers within the crater;  these layers now give the mounds their distinctive stair-stepped appearance, and are all that remain from this once extensive deposit.
PSP_008931_1590	This image crosses the mouth of Ladon Valles where it enters into Ladon Basin in Margaritifer Terra. Ladon Valles is an outflow channel forming a segment of a larger system that heads in Argyre basin to the south and eventually links up with the larger Ares Valles outflow channel to the north.<br><br>Water flowing out of Ladon Valles appears to have ponded within Ladon basin, as evidenced by the numerous exposed layers. It is possible that these layers are exposed as a result of late flow down Ladon Valles that occurred after Holden Crater formed to the southwest. This late flow may have eroded the pre-existing layers deposited by prior flow.<br>
PSP_008938_1750	Gale Crater is approximately 150 kilometers in diameter and located near the dichotomy boundary between the Martian southern highlands and the northern lowlands.<br><br>The central mound of Gale Crater is of interest to scientists because itís composed of light-toned layered deposits that extend higher than the rim of the crater. The origin of the sediments making up the layers is unknown, but possible formations include deposition in an ancient flood or lake, or the deposition of windblown particles such as dust or volcanic ash. Wind erosion has been an active process in Gale, modifying the layered deposits by creating sharp edges, a scalloped texture, and rounded depressions.<br><br>This image is located on the northeastern part of the central mound inside the crater.
PSP_008942_1825	The northern slope of this unnamed crater in Arabia Terra exhibits light- and dark-toned slope streaks that are common on Mars.<br><br>Most scientists believe that slope streaks are formed by the downslope movement of very dry, fine-grained dust, similar to an avalanche on Earth. Darker slope streaks are thought to be younger than lighter slope streaks.<br><br>This image <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008942_1825_cut.jpg'><strong>shows a unique dark streak</strong></a> that split around a knob sticking out from the crater wall and then joined back together downslope.
PSP_008963_1650	This image shows the MER Spirit rover at its location on the north edge of Home Plate in the Columbia Hills, and was taken on the southern hemisphere winter solstice at about 2 p.m. local time on Spirit‚Äôs 1,591st sol on Mars. <br><br>Home Plate is the elevated round and light toned mesa on the right side of the image. <a href=images/2008/details/cut/PSP_008963_1650_cut.jpg><strong>Spirit is visible at the large dark ‚Äúbump‚Äù</strong></a> on the north-northeast edge of Home Plate. The image was acquired at mid-winter because that is the time of the clearest and least dusty atmosphere. <br><br>The optical clarity of the sky is measured as a value called ‚Äútau‚Äù and can range from 0.15 in winter to 6.0 (or higher) like that seen last summer. Spirit measured a ‚Äútau‚Äù of  0.19 the day before this image was acquired; the clarity of the sky was about as good as it gets. Another factor in making this image special is the low-angle lighting of mid-winter, which results in slightly longer shadows. Long shadows aid in detecting small features like rocks, outcrops, and low ridges and scarps. The bowl-like upturned edges of Home Plate are emphasized by this low-angle lighting.<br><br>Just east of Home Plate is a ridge, informally named Mitcheltree Ridge. During its field season last Martian summer, Spirit discovered unusual high silica deposits between the ridge and Home Plate. These deposits are comparable in many ways to high-silica spring deposits of Earth. To the south of Home Plate‚Äîa roughly circular area nearly the same size‚Äîis another mesa informally named Crossfield. Just to the southwest of that are two unusual features, a butte and a crater (informally named Von Braun and Goddard, respectively).<br><br>Another purpose of this image is to aid in selecting a traverse in the coming field season. Spirit will leave Home Plate, drive west and south around the north edge, south along the bottom of the valley between Home Plate and the long ridge to the west informally named Tsiolkovski, and then southward towards the butte and crater farther south.<br>
PSP_008982_1965	This image shows the floor of an unnamed impact crater in Arabia Terra that has layered deposits. There are many craters in this region where layering is observed.<br><br>These layers are often exposed along the sides of large isolated mounds, small knobs and mesas, and other positive relief features. In some cases, the layering is expressed as narrow sinuous ridge-like structures along crater floors.<br><br>The presence of layered deposits is of particular interest because these materials are not likely to be related to the impact event, but rather post-impact infill of the crater. Modification of the deposits has now revealed layers of material.<br><br>HiRISE and other instruments onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter may provide more clues to the origin of the these deposits.
PSP_009003_1890	This image shows a part of the Cerberus Fossae, a system of aligned fissures east of Elysium.<br><br>The fissures were probably the source of floods of both water and lava. The most recent event was a massive outpouring of basaltic lava (a fluid-type of lava like that commonly erupted by Kilauea in Hawaii), which produced a host of volcanic features in the region, as described by Jaeger et al. (2007). <br><br>Here, as at other locations, the fossae appear a <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009000_009099/PSP_009003_1890/PSP_009003_1890_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>striking blue in HiRISE false color</strong></a>. Blue tones are usually associated with basaltic rock. The blue ripples found on the trough floor could be wind-blown sand comprised of fine fragments of basalt. The upper plains are a relatively bland tone, perhaps due to a thin coating of dust; however, impact craters in the image also show bluish boulders and ripples, indicating that they have excavated the same basaltic rock layers cut by the fossae. This is typical of the region, as floods of lava coat much of the area. <br><br>The mesas of older rock just north of the fissures are remnants of a former surface, now eroded. The surrounding region has many knobs and larger protruding topography, which may be remnants of the same materials. The topmost layer in each mesa is very resistant to weathering, as in places it actually overhangs the lower rocks. This cap layer could be solidified lava, although it appears somewhat bland in color.<br><br>Although the mesa is clearly eroded and the cap rock breaks up into boulders, few rocks are visible at the bottom of the slope. The lava plains may have buried the former basal slope, or debris may have been swept away by lava or floodwater, that could also have contributed to eroding the mesa.<br>
PSP_009011_1705	This image shows an apparent valley north of a 37-kilometer long pit called Ophir Cavus.This valley is just west of another 155-km long valley system called Allegheny Vallis that also emanates from the pit.<br><br>The association of valleys with the pit suggests that water was released when the pit formed, perhaps when volcanic eruptions melted ice in the surface or subsurface. The HiRISE image reveals light-toned units along portions of the plains and these could be minerals deposited by the flowing water or alteration of the plains by the water that once flowed here.
PSP_009029_1430	This observation reveals a portion of a long outcrop of a deposit in the Electris region of Mars.<br><br>The Electris deposits occur over a range of landforms and relief and the process(es) responsible for their emplacement remain speculative.<br><br>Close examination of the outcrops reveal layering that in some places appear to include meter-scale blocks. Comparison with other HiRISE images of the deposit will enable more detailed mapping of its extent and nature and should provide new insight into the origin of these enigmatic materials.<br>
PSP_009039_1660	This image shows two landforms that appear similar, but are the result of two very different geologic processes.<br><br>These two depressions are craters. The smaller, rounder crater formed when an asteroid collided with Mars. This impact blasted out the pre-existing rocks, forming this quasi-circular crater.<br><br>The larger, more irregular-shaped crater is a pit crater. These types of craters form through collapse of the ground surface into large underground voids. In this region of Mars, these underground voids are likely caused by the movement of magma (molten rock) through the subsurface. As the magma moves underground, it forces the rock apart and forms large &ldquo;caverns.&rdquo; These voids are structurally unstable and can lead to collapse of the overlying rock, forming pit craters at the surface.<br><br>Impact craters are distinguished from pit craters by the presence of a raised rim. Rock blasted out during the impact falls back to the ground and accumulates near the crater, forming this raised rim. Upward warping of the ground during the impact process also contributes to the raised appearance of the crater rim. Since pit craters form through collapse, their rims are at the same level, or perhaps slightly lower, than surrounding ground surface.<br><br>The impact crater has a bright streak extending southeast (toward the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009000_009099/PSP_009039_1660/PSP_009039_1660_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>lower right</strong></a>). The bright material is dust, deposited downwind of the crater by prevailing winds.  Zooming into the streak, small bedforms, presumably composed of dust or dust aggregates, are visible.  Similar features are seen in other dusty regions of Mars.<br>
PSP_009087_2550	This north polar dune field is bounded by a small unnamed crater about 11 kilometers in diameter in the Vastitas Borealis region. This crater captured deposits of basaltic sand that may have been transported from the North Polar Erg, a massive sea of sand that surrounds the Martian northern pole.<br><br>This region experiences a variety of winds that blow from various directions during different seasons and times of day, and the winds are also affected by the topography of the crater itself. This influences the movement of sand within the crater and the dunes that they shape.<br><br>This image shows many transitioning dunes which indicate changes of wind direction. The wind direction can be inferred from the location of the steeper side of the dune (called the slip-face) which is downwind of the dominant wind direction. The barchans and barchanoid dunes form crescent shapes and are consistent with dominant winds from the southwest.<br><br>Towards the center of the dune field, the barchans transition from crescent shapes into irregular, more elongated dunes and merge. The more northern part of the dune field consists of longitudinal dunes which extend from the horns of modified barchans in the central part of the dune field. These longitudinal dunes form along the trend of southerly-southeasterly winds. <br><br>Because it is early summer, solar radiation has heated the sand and there are only a few small patches of frost remaining on the dunes at this season. However,  evidence of the arctic climate is visible in the polygons surrounding the dune field. The polygons, like those found at the Phoenix Mission landing site, are produced by freeze-thaw cycles as the polar soil expands and contracts.<br>
PSP_009114_2645	Sand moves along a planetary surface by a process scientists call &ldquo;saltation,&rdquo; whereby the individual grains are driven by the wind and bounce forward in short hops. In a process that is not yet completely understood, sheets of saltating sand grains organize themselves into sand dunes, visible in this image as the dark features.<br><br>Sand dunes move by having the wind push sand grains up and over the top of the dune where they then slide down to the base. The steep side of the dune that the sand grains slide down is called the slip-face and it is the constant transport of sand from the downwind side of the dune to the slip-face that makes the dune move forward in this direction. HiRISE data allow us to see which side of these dunes has the steeper slope (the slip-face), telling us what direction the dune&mdash;and strong near surface winds&mdash;are moving (in this case the slip-faces point almost directly to the left).<br><br>Yet something else is also happening to these particular dunes. Dark streaks lead away from the dunes toward the lower left of the image. These streaks are caused by sand grains being blown off the dunes and saltating away. This is not ordinarily a cause for concern because in a stable dune, individual grains are constantly added and removed; however, there does not appear to be any influx of sand upwind of these dunes, so they are probably being eroded.<br><br>It is also interesting that these streaks do not point in the same direction as the slip-face. One possible scenario is that the dunes migrated westward when sand supply was more plentiful. Today, the wind direction has shifted, blowing more toward the southwest, and the influx of new sand has ceased, such that in the future, the dunes will completely erode away. Repeated HiRISE observations will be able to look for changes in the shape and size of these dunes.<br>
PSP_009138_2025	There is evidence of phyllosilicate material (clays) throughout this region, named Nili Fossae.  The evidence comes from the <a href='http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMUC75V9ED_0.html'><strong>OMEGA experiment</strong></a> on the European Space Agencyís Mars Express spacecraft and <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, infrared spectrometers that can identify minerals on the surface of Mars.<br><br>In the Nili Fossae region, the spectrometers have found remarkable diversity in surface composition. Because of the evidence for clays and other interesting geology,  Nili Fossae is also being considered as a landing site for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory rover</strong></a>.<br><br>HiRISE has targeted several places where OMEGA and CRISM show extreme diversity, <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009138_2025_cut.jpg'><strong>with this being one example.</strong></a> In this specific area, low-calcium pyroxene (LCP) materials are adjacent to these clays. The cracked terrain regions evident at the highest resolution provide clues to the sequence of events which occurred in Nili Fossae.<br>
PSP_009149_1750	Gale Crater is a large, approximately 152 kilometer-diameter impact crater that lies near the Martian equator. Contained within the crater is a massive central mound of layered material. With an average vertical thickness of almost 4 km (2.4 miles), the Gale Crater layered deposits are twice as thick as the layers exposed along the Grand Canyon on Earth.<br><br>Shown here is a portion of the mound with an inverted fluvial or river channel. Topographic inversion occurs when sediments are cemented together, forming a harder layer that is resistant to later erosion. This later erosion has preferentially removed material outside the channel, leaving the former riverbed exposed as a ridge&mdash;a topographic high.  This inverted channel was originally detected by scientists using Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) images onboard the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/'><strong>Mars Global Surveyor</strong></a> spacecraft.<br><br>Color variations visible in this image are mostly due to variable amounts of loose dark sediment that has accumulated unevenly across the scene.
PSP_009151_1465	This image shows part of the floor of a large impact crater in the southern hemisphere. The crater lies at the edge of the Hellas impact basin; although it is roughly 50 kilometers across, it is dwarfed by the giant Hellas structure, which has seen a varied and interesting geologic history. <br><br>This image captures a diverse range of rocks on the crater floor. A small cliff running across the middle of the image marks the edge of one rock unit, but variations in tone or texture in the northern part of the image suggest a varied history of deposition. Exposures of light, intermediate and dark materials may correspond to different types of deposition, or perhaps alteration after the rocks were laid down. Some units appear rich in boulders, suggesting that they are breaking up into blocks, while at other sites there are thin layers. <br><br>This diversity indicates a varied geologic history. Hellas Basin is a low region, and may have once held lakes or seas where sediments could have been deposited. This site is also just west of Hadriaca Patera, an old volcano. Sediment could also have been deposited by wind, or in streams on the surface. Unraveling the history of the region will require many images to illustrate the diversity of rocks and map out where they occur.<br>
PSP_009155_1480	This image shows a rather pristine crater with gullies and bedrock exposures. The gullies are mostly on the south-facing (poleward facing) wall. Some of the gully channels are very sharp,  indicating that they have not been modified much since they formed.<br><br>Other channels criss-cross each other, demonstrating that there were multiple periods of activity. Scientists do not know how closely these were spaced in time. <br><br>The south and east walls of the crater have very distinct bright layers. These layers are possibly ancient bedrock. These walls also have what appear to be bright landslides.<br>
PSP_009156_1335	These gullies are in the Nereidum Montes near the large Argyre Basin in the southern hemisphere. Downslope, the gullies interact with other features. Some of the gully debris aprons cross a trough that lines the slope base. The debris aprons cover dunes lying in the trough, which indicates that both the dunes and trough were there before the gully activity. <br><br>The north half of the image is covered in boulders and some linear features that might have resulted from boulders tumbling or being dragged around. The south half of the image features gullies, which are thought to be fluvial features.<br><br>Beyond the trough there is a wavy ridge. The ridge has some landslides off of it that have extended onto nearby dunes.
PSP_009160_2350	This scene features a high latitude, northern hemisphere crater with double-layered ejecta. The sharp rim and lack of small superposed craters indicates that this crater is relatively young. <br><br>The semi-circular feature that parallels the crater rim is a terrace that probably formed as part of the crater wall collapsed into the center. The circular mound in the center likely formed at the same time as the crater itself. Large craters on Mars can have central peaks; this crater looks like it was on the cusp of having one. The linear features surrounding the crater on its ejecta are striations that formed during the impact as material and wind exploded out from the center.<br><br>At the bottom of the scene is a very distinct ejecta flow lobe (lobate ejecta). Lobate ejecta is thought to form when an impact occurs on a surface with lots of volatiles&mdash;ices that quickly turn to gas when they are heated. The gases help make the ejecta flow like a fluid.<br>
PSP_009161_1450	Ariadnes Colles is a labyrinth-like cluster of hills, mesas, and knobs located near Terra Cimmeria, in the Southern Highlands of Mars. <br><br>This image, which covers a portion of that labyrinth, was acquired only a few sols (Martian days) away from winter solstice. Winter solstice occurs in the shortest sol of the year, when the Sun travels the lowest in the Martian sky, making shadows appear very long. These conditions are ideal to analyze modest relief features, that would pass unnoticed when illuminated from above but are highlighted when illuminated from the side. <br><br>This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009161_1450_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage</strong></a> of the <a href='http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/compositor/'><strong>enhanced-color</strong></a> combination shows one of the hills in detail.<br><br>The hill appears criss-crossed by long fractures, most of them made apparent by the shadows they cast. The shadows indicate that the fractures ìstick outî from their surroundings, and hence that they are more resistant to erosion. In terrestrial environments this occurs when fluids flow along the fractures, leaving behind cementing minerals or when fractures are filled by <a href='http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/rxmin/rock.html#igneous'><strong>igneous materials</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_009162_1570	The crater featured in this scene formed on top of ejecta from a nearby rampart crater, located to the north.<br><br>The crater&rsquo;s distinct rim indicates it is relatively young. There is bright material on many of the crater walls that might be landslides of dust or another bright substance. <br><br>The mounds of material on the crater floor probably formed during late stages of crater&rsquo;s own formation. The crater floor is speckled with even smaller craters.  <br>
PSP_009174_1650	This image of  the MER Spirit rover‚Äôs  location on Home Plate in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater was acquired on Spirit‚Äôs 1,607th sol (Mars day) on Mars, and approximately 16 sols after southern hemisphere mid-winter.<br><br>At about the same time that this image was taken by HiRISE, Spirit was acquiring a measurement of atmospheric ‚Äútau,‚Äù a measure of the clarity of the atmosphere. On this sol the tau was at a value of 0.24 and on the sol of the previous HiRISE image (<a href='PSP_008963_1650'><strong>PSP_008963_1650</strong></a>),  acquired precisely on the winter solstice, tau was slightly lower at 0.19. These values are close to the mean value of atmosphere clarity for winter and are considered very clear. <br><br>Most of the variation  in atmospheric clarity is a result of differences in dust lofted into the atmosphere. During the previous summer, a large dust storm resulted in significantly dusty skies. On Spirit‚Äôs sol 1293‚Äînear previous summer solstice HiRISE image <a href='PSP_005034_1650'><strong>PSP_005034_1650</strong></a>‚Äîanother image was acquired during a significant dust storm when the tau was 2.9, among the higher values observed. <br><br>In this winter image, Spirit is visible as a large ‚Äúrock‚Äù on the north edge of Home Plate, a two meter high, circular platform of sediments 80 meters across. Spirit casts a long shadow to the southeast because, even though the image was taken in mid-afternoon, it was near mid-winter when the sun is low in the sky. On the western edge of Home Plate, if one looks closely, one may see the tracks left as Spirit drove along the west side of Home Plate on its way north to its stop over place for Winter 3.<br>
PSP_009177_1985	This image shows part of a broad field of cratered cones in the Isidis Planitia region of Mars. The cones occur over a wide area and are commonly aligned in chains, like those here. <br><br>The cratered-cone morphology suggests formation by eruption of some material. The cones resemble small volcanoes on Earth called cinder cones, and are approximately the same size. Another possibility is that these are mud volcanoes, formed by eruption of wet, pressurized mud. This has been suggested as an important process in some parts of Mars. The aligned chains probably indicate sites of weakness, perhaps faults, where lava or mud could preferentially rise. <br><br>The scene is relatively bland in color, but this could be due to a thin coating of dust veiling color differences. The cones are clearly not very young or pristine; they have a battered, pitted appearance. However, they have not been heavily eroded, as features like the cone rims are still sharp in most cases. This state is typical of the cones in Isidis region.<br>
PSP_009180_1840	Arabia Terra is an area of Mars that has an abundance of layered deposits within impact craters.<br><br>The region of Arabia has plateau material that is thought to be part of the ancient highland crust that is <a href='http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Martian-geologic-timescale'><strong>Noachian in age according to Martian timescale.</strong></a> Thus, the layered deposits may represent some of the earliest eroded and infilled materials on Mars. In this unnamed crater, we see <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009180_1840_cut.jpg'><strong>layering exposed along the margins</strong></a> of a scarp-like bench.<br><br>The layering is of particular interest because on Earth, they may represent multiple sequences of deposited material or some geologic process (subaerial or subaqueous) that has modified and/or deposited material on the surface in some constant fashion. If the layered sequences are consistently the same, we can infer that the conditions of their deposition were the same for some period of time. If the layers changed in some way (e.g., thickens and thins), then we can infer that some condition(s) caused this to happen. From these observations and analyses, scientists can attempt to quantify and reconstruct what the ancient conditions were like in this region of Mars.<br>
PSP_009192_1890	<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009192_1890_cut.jpg'><strong>This slope streak</strong></a> occurred in the time between a Viking image of the bottom of this crater (<a href='http://global-data.mars.asu.edu/viking/img/713A57'><strong>713A57</strong></a>, which saw no streak) and a MOC image (<a href='http://global-data.mars.asu.edu/moc/images/R12/01917'><strong>R12/01917</strong></a>, as reported by <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Icar..191..132S'><strong>Schorghofer et al. (2007)</strong></a>.<br><br>That paper suggested that the slope streak may have been caused by a dust devil that had passed by (its track is visible in the MOC image). Our HiRISE image shows that there isnít a small hill or anything at this slope streakís apex, but that the dust devil track really does intersect with the apex. It is likely that the dust devil may have caused this slope streak. <br><br>Dark slope streaks are visible in many places on the Martian surface, often where the dust cover is thick. One explanation for dark slope streaks is that they are little avalanches in the dust. The apexes of slope streaks (where they start from) are often at little hills or ridges on a larger slope, with the thinking that the dust here is already close to being too steep, and then any little perturbation will start one of these tiny avalanches. Small craters have also been seen at slope streak apexes.<br>
PSP_009233_2535	This small unnamed crater is adjacent to the North Polar Erg and contains a fascinating dune field. Scientists are interested in the source of the dunes in the crater and the evolution of the dune field‚Äôs circular shape.<br><br>Wind transports material and shapes the dunes; the dominant wind comes from a westerly-southwesterly direction and forms barchans (crescent-shaped) and barchanoid dunes. Secondary winds also play a role in shaping the dunes. This can be seen in the southern part of the dune field where the barchans  transition into transverse dunes. On the northern edge of the dune field are opposite facing barchans formed by winds from the northeast. <br><br>The circular shape of this dune field is interesting because the outer dunes reflect changing winds whereas the central dunes do not. This could indicate several distinct stages in the formation of the dune field. On top of the dark dunes are tiny ripples similar to those seen on top of sand dunes on Earth. It is likely that these dune ripples are active, as shown by avalanches (grainflow) <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009233_2535_cut.jpg'><strong>from the crest of the dunes.</strong></a><br>
PSP_009293_2645	The polar layered deposits on Mars are thought contain a record of global climate changes, similar to ice ages on Earth. This image shows that the geologic history of the north polar layered deposits (NPLD) has been complex enough to form angular unconformities. <br><br>An angular unconformity represents a gap in the geologic record, where erosion has removed material followed by deposition of more material on the eroded surface. <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009200_009299/PSP_009293_2645/PSP_009293_2645_RED.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>In this image,</strong></a> the angular unconformities are recognized by the truncation, or cutting off of layers, for example right of center and at bottom center.  <br><br>Also visible in this image are numerous streaks, perhaps caused by recent redistribution of frost by winds. <br>
PSP_009295_2565	This location is where Mars Global Surveyor (a previous Mars orbiter) saw evidence of dunes that either shrank or completely disappeared over a span of a few years. HiRISE provides new details at higher resolution.<br><br>As seen here, the dunes show clear evidence of erosion.  Based on the shape of the dunes in this picture, the strongest winds have blown from the lower right (southeast) to upper left (northwest). Streamers of dark sand are visible on the white, frost-covered surface downwind of the dunes.  This is particularly prominent at the &ldquo;horns&rdquo; of the barchan dunes (these are the dunes with the prominent points at their edges). <br><br>Scientists believe these dunes are cemented, by ice, such that the wind is progressively eroding them over time.  Future observations by HiRISE will determine if the dunes shrink as indicated by MGS, or maybe even migrate, over time.<br>
PSP_009318_1465	This image shows a series of knobs, channels and inverted channels in the ancient southern highlands of Mars.<br><br>The inverted channels, which now appear as sinuous ridges, are filled with a fractured light-toned material that is also <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009318_1465_cut.jpg'><strong>apparent in the knobs and nearby bedrock</strong></a>. Previous analyses of the infrared data from TES and <a href='http://themis.asu.edu/'><strong>THEMIS</strong></a> of similar materials in Terra Sirenum and elsewhere on Mars suggest that these light-toned materials are deposits of chloride salts such as sodium chloride (ordinary rock salt).<br><br>Salt deposits are key targets in the search for ancient life on Mars, because they represent places where bodies of liquid water may have ponded and evaporated. The salt forms an ideal setting in which to preserve signs of biological activity. The clear association of the salt with the sinuous channels visible here suggests that the material was precipitated from brines that once flowed through these channels. The fractured surface of the deposits is consistent with cracking by desiccation (rapid drying) of the thick salts as they were deposited.<br>
PSP_009319_1650	Gusev Crater is decorated by tracks made by dust devils that have been observed by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), and HiRISE images. Dust devils are of interest because they may clean the solar panels that provide power to Spirit, and are partially responsible for dust transportation on the surface of Mars. <br><br>Dust devils are actually giant convective vortices that form as a result of atmospheric vertical instability. Solar radiation warms the surface, forcing air to rise to an atmospheric convective boundary, where it then cools. The denser, cold air parcel descends and generates a circulation that creates a suction effect. <br><br>As the dust devil picks up material from the bright dust-mantled surface, it exposes the darker basaltic substrate. These scribble marks will follow the prevailing winds and tend to cluster together as the lower albedo surface heats up more quickly. Scientists are trying to understand the relationship between dust devils and craters and other topographic features that generate multiple wind directions.<br><br>To monitor the changes in dust removed and deposited, this HiRISE observation and MOC E1202049 are examined that have an Earth time span of 6 years, 6 months, and 3 days. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009319_1650_cut.jpg'><strong>These two images</strong></a> were acquired during the opposite seasons; PSP_009319_1650 during the late southern winter and E1202049 during late southern summer/early fall. The dust devils tracks reflect the seasons as activity increases when temperatures peak in the summer. <br><br>This pair of images also shows darker regions that dictate where the dust devils occur and show that there has either been only light deposition of dust from the time the MOC image was acquired, or a repeating cycle of dust erosion and deposition.
PSP_009322_1920	This image repeats part of the coverage of a previous image (PSP_002347_1915) that was acquired to search for the lost Beagle 2 lander.  However, the first image was acquired near equinox (subsolar latitude near equator) and this new image was acquired near northern summer solstice (subsolar latitude near 25 N).  As a result, the lighting angles are different, and comparison of the two images provides new information about the morphology of the surface.  
PSP_009352_1770	This image is one of the proposed landing sites for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) and is located in southern Meridiani Planum (to the south of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landing site). <br><br>The image shows fairly smooth plains with small ripples, suggesting that wind is an active process here. The landing site is on the smooth hematite-bearing plains, and the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; science target would include phyllosilicates (clay-minerals) that the CRISM instrument has detected in the mounds to the south of the landing ellipse (which begin in the southern part of the image).  <br><br>Scientists believe phyllosilicates formed in the presence of water, which is of interest for the MSL mission goals, including possible past habitability. The suite of instruments on-board MSL could also help characterize the sulfate materials, which Opportunity has been studying since 2004. <br>
PSP_009356_1835	Snaking across this observation is a ridged margin that in the enchanced color version, appears as though it separates two parts of a canvas.<br><br><a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_009356_1835_cut.jpg'><strong>On closer examination,</strong></a> it almost looks as though there is a relatively smooth landscape on the left, and pockmarked terrain on the right.<br><br>The ridge itself is revealed in incredible detail with what appear to be "gulley-esque" grooves running its length.<br><br>Pavonis Mons is part of what is called Tharsis Montes, being the middle of three volcanoes in this region. The name "Pavonis Mons" itself is Latin for "Mount Peacock."
PSP_009368_1720	This image spans the floor of Ius Chasma&rsquo;s southern trench. Ius Chasma is located in the western region of Valles Marineris, the solar system&rsquo;s largest canyon. This canyon is well known for its fine stratigraphic layers modified by wind and water.  <br><br>The outcrops contain interchanging layers of dark and bright rocks. The layered deposits consist of dark basalt lava flows and bright sedimentary layers. The sediments are likely to be from atmospheric dust, sand, or alluvium from an ancient water source. The layers are visible on the gentle slopes above the canyon floor, in pitted areas, and in small mesa buttes. The floor of the canyon is littered with megaripples that are aligned in a north-south direction. <br><br>Ius Chasma is believed to have been shaped by a process called sapping when water seeped from the layers of the cliffs and evaporated before it reached the canyon floor. This process is thought  to have dominated during the <a href='http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Martian-geologic-timescale'><strong>Amazonian period.</strong></a><br><br>Ius Chasma also has several structural features such as east trending normal faults and grabens that deformed the canyons. Recent geomorphological events include mass wasting (avalanches) and minor sapping from gullies that continued to erode the canyon walls.<br>
PSP_009390_2595	This image features the north polar layered deposits. The flat tongue-shaped feature at the bottom of the image is the surface of the cap.<br><br>The bright textured region near the top of the image is polygonal ground, which is commonly found in the Martian high-latitudes. Polygonal ground formation is thought to relate to temperature cycles in ice-rich soil.<br><br>Just south of the polygonal ground, a bright layer within the cap can be seen eroding in the form of landslides, particularly near the center of the image.<br><br>The most noticeable part of the polar cap is visible in an unconformity, the horizontal break in the cap layers. An unconformity is caused by non-uniform erosion or deposition. In this case, non-uniform erosion or deposition might have occurred due to variable climate over geologic time.<br>
PSP_009393_1890	Because HiRISE images resolve details at scales less than a meter, this image and others similar to it of uneroded impact craters, offer opportunities to examine the details of the impact cratering process.<br><br>This is a very well-preserved crater in the northern hemisphere. Because the features on the crater rim, walls, and floor are very sharp, rather than rounded, it appears to have undergone very little erosion or other modification since its formation. <br><br>Several interesting characteristics are notable in this observation. The north part of the image shows striations on the ejecta that formed from the impact blast. The crater rim has a large number of bright landslides, probably resulting from slumping on steep, unstable slopes that are typical of well-preserved craters. <br><br>Some of the terraces within the crater have fluvial-like channels which might have been carved shortly after crater formation from impact-induced precipitation. Other processes involving flow of a media behaving like a fluid and capable of small channel erosion (for example, impact melt or cascades of sandy debris) may have also contributed to the formation.<br><br>Finally, this crater has a central pit. Central pits may form from release of volatiles, ices in the surface that becomes gases during the later stages of the impact process.<br>
PSP_009396_2590	This image shows a traverse across a section of the North Polar erg, a vast sea of sand that surrounds the polar cap.<br><br>The source of the dunes may be from the eroding north polar layered deposits. Wind, acting on this mixture of sand, dust, and ice, has formed several dune types on top of bright megaripples and polygons. A dark mantle of sand lies beyond the dunes.  <br><br>The central part of the field contains transverse dunes with the dominant wind direction coming from the northwest-west. The outer edges of the dune field transition into star dunes (with multiple arms) and barchanoid dunes (crescent-like shape). The star dunes indicate a multidirectional wind regime or a change in wind direction over the dune field&#146;s evolution. The dunes are somewhat confined to their location and may have taken hundreds of years to form.
PSP_009460_1745	This image shows a steep-sided depression in light-toned, layered rocks in the Valles Marineris canyon system. This formation, known as Ceti Mensa, is located in western Candor Chasma in the northern Valles.<br><br>The origin of Ceti Mensa and other layered deposits within the canyons is a source of much debate: proposed interpretations include lake deposits, deposits of volcanic ash, deposits of windblown sand and dust, and glacial deposits. Recent spectral observations by the Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft have identified crystalline iron oxides and hydrated magnesium sulfate minerals on Ceti Mensa. These minerals are regarded as indicators of the presence of liquid water during their formation. The hydrated sulfate mineral kieserite, in particular, most commonly forms on Earth by evaporation of brines. <br><br>This image gives another clue to the formation of Ceti Mensa. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009460_1745_cut.jpg'><strong>Close-up examination</strong></a> shows fine banding in the layers of Ceti Mensa that is exposed by the ongoing erosion. The banding is produced by alternating bright and dark material. The thickness of the individual bands ranges from a few meters down to the resolution limit of the image, a few tens of centimeters. The bands are parallel, although they appear wavy on the irregular, eroded surface.<br><br>The banding visible in this image most closely resembles terrestrial lake deposits and similar rocks formed in aqueous, low energy depositional environments. Structures such as cross-bedding that are hallmarks of wind-deposited sediments are absent, as are cobbles and clasts that are typical of glacial sediments. <br><br>If this interpretation is correct, the thickness of Ceti Mensa suggests formation in standing bodies of water that were several kilometers deep.<br><br>
PSP_009474_1705	Noctis Labyrinthus consists of a series of pits on the western end of the large Valles Marineris canyon system. <br><br>The HiRISE camera and the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> spectrometer have revealed that the floors of some of these pits exhibit layered rocks, or strata, that contain minerals with water. These pits were formed several billion years ago, therefore the rocks and sediments on their floors record evidence of water during this period of Mars‚Äô history.<br><br>The walls of the pits are commonly covered with dust and other loose sediments that form dunes and dune-like forms, and in many cases the floors of the pits are also covered with these materials. This image shows an example of light-toned layers exposed beneath these sediments and dunes, and CRISM data show that these layers have hydrated minerals. The blue tones in the false color image correspond to areas with more pyroxene, a mineral found in volcanic rocks and Martian dust. Some pits, such as this one, appear to have deposits associated with large landslides that are younger than the hydrated minerals and partially bury them.<br>
PSP_009485_2185	This HiRISE image shows clusters of light-colored mounds poking through the dark plains of Acidalia. These mounds are similar in shape and color to mounds identified elsewhere in the Northern Lowlands.<br><br>The mounds imaged here are approximately 250 meters (270 yards) across, and most of them have one or more central crater-like depressed areas, looking like terrestrial <a href='http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/CinderCone.htmlterrestrial'><strong>cinder cones</strong></a>. Terrestrial cinder cones are formed by loose volcanic fragments, mostly gravel- and boulder-size. In contrast, the surface of these Martian mounds looks cemented rather than bouldery.<br><br>There are several hypothesis to explain the origin of these Martian mounds; all of them require the presence of fluids near or at the surface. <br><br>One hypothesis is that these mounds are hydrothermal spring edifices like those at <a href='http://www.nps.gov/archive/yell/tours/oldfaithful/beehive.htm'><strong>Yellowstone</strong></a>. Terrestrial hydrothermal spring mounds form when hot subsurface fluids, loaded with minerals, reach the surface and deposit their load.<br><br>Another possible explanation is that these mounds are <a href='http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2005/05_10_13.html'><strong>mud volcanoes</strong></a>, similar to those found at <a href='http://www.gstt.org/teaching/mud%20volcanoes.htm'><strong>Trinidad and Tobago</strong></a>. Mud volcanism occurs when buried wet sediments are subject to high pressures and squeeze out though weak points at the surface.<br><br>Some terrestrial <a href='http://www3.hi.is/~arnie/pscrat2.htm'><strong>pseudocraters</strong></a> are also similar to these Martian mounds. Pseudocraters form when lava flows over wet terrains or over water bodies. The lava‚Äôs heat vaporizes the fluids, which then burst through the lava, producing small explosions and building conical landforms.<br>
PSP_009488_1745	Pit craters exist in volcanic regions across Mars, and form when surface materials collapse into large underground cavities. Such pits are generally bowl-shaped, filled with sediment, and are relatively shallow when compared with their diameters.<br><br>Recently, a small number of anomalous pit craters were identified with strikingly different visible and thermal characteristics such as: sheer cliff walls; deep interiors that can extend out-of-sight beneath the surface; and temperature fluctuations that behave unlike any known feature on Mars. <br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009488_1745_cut_a.jpg'><strong>The pair of pit craters visible here</strong></a> are the smallest ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù pits known to exist at this time. These have either vertical or sub-vertical interior walls (not visible from a nearly overhead viewing perspective), and each pit is deep enough that sunlight does not hit the floor when it‚Äôs at the zenith. Unfortunately, the only thermal-infrared camera currently orbiting Mars cannot resolve features this small, so the temperature characteristics of these pits must remain unknown for now, underscoring the need for a high-resolution thermal instrument on future missions.  <br><br>Intriguingly, when pit craters on Earth have similar characteristics <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009488_1745_cut_b.jpg'><strong>to the pair shown here,</strong></a> they often have cave entrances in their bases connecting to large underground networks. Current investigations are determining whether the anomalous Martian pits may be shown to contain such entrances.<br><br>The ability to detect and <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009488_1745_cut_c.jpg'><strong>explore Martian caves</strong></a> is of intense interest to many disciplines in planetary science. Caves may expose entire sets of stratigraphic layers, providing windows into Mars‚Äô geologic and atmospheric histories.<br><br>Cave environments can also protect organic life from extremely harsh conditions on the Martian surface, and may provide future human explorers with secure habitats. Accordingly, caves are considered among the most promising locations to find preserved evidence of past or present microbial life.<br><br>Furthermore, the challenges associated with Mars cave exploration may inspire a range new  technologies, such as advanced robotics and target-specific landing capabilities. <br>
PSP_009497_1770	This image is one of the proposed landing sites for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> (MSL) and is located in southern Meridiani Planum (to the south of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landing site). <br><br>The image shows fairly smooth plains with small ripples, suggesting that wind is an active process here. The landing site is on the smooth hematite-bearing plains, and the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; science target would include phyllosilicates (clay-minerals) that the CRISM instrument has detected in the mounds to the south of the landing ellipse (which begin in the southern part of the image).  <br><br>Scientists believe phyllosilicates formed in the presence of water, which is of interest for the MSL mission goals, including possible past habitability.

PSP_009498_1730	Chaotic terrains on Mars are regions of rugged hills and mesas covering the floors of low areas. They are thought to form by collapse of the original terrain, likely accompanied by massive release of groundwater. Many chaos regions are associated with giant outflow channels carved by massive floods. <br><br>This image shows part of the floor of Aurorae Chaos, an irregular region east of Valles Marineris. An interesting feature in this image is the occurrence of some light-toned sediments. These are best visible near the center of the image. Some of the outcrops have thin layers, while others have a peculiar scalloped appearance which might be associated with wind erosion. <br><br>These outcrops could indicate deposition of sediments on the floor of the chaos after it formed, but the process itself is not certain. The outcrops were probably protected from erosion by resistant layers; the dark, flat-topped regions in the southern part of the image appear to be the top of a strong layer overlying other rocks. <br><br>The light sediments might be more extensive than the visible outcrops, but much of the area is covered by ripples of dark wind-blown sand. These are oriented in many directions, since troughs between large ripples channel the wind at right angles and form smaller secondary ripples.<br><br>This image is a stereo pair for observation <a href='PSP_007705_1730'><strong>PSP_007705_1730</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_009501_1755	This lava flow field is part of a small shield volcano within the lava plains south of Pavonis Mons. It illustrates the importance of lava tubes  in the formation of large lava flow fields. <br><br>Shield volcanoes are often covered by a combination of open lava channels and partly enclosed lava tubes, through which lava once flowed when the volcano was active.  Tubes are often located axial to topographic ridges, and after a lava flow ends, a tube can drain leaving an empty space into which the roof can collapse.<br><br>However, if a tube is filled to capacity or under pressure when the lava is flowing, narrow ridge-like features and/or small lava flow breakouts can form. This scenario is one possible explanation for the ridged lava flow in the center of this image. Here, a narrow wall-like feature is axial to a larger topographic ridge that appears to be the source for a series of smaller lava flows.<br>
PSP_009502_1980	This image covers a relatively dark-toned patch of ground west of the Olympus Mons volcano. This spot is one of several dark areas in this region of Mars. <br><br>These dark spots are distinctive because much of the surrounding area appears to be covered by light-toned dust. In pre-HiRISE images, the origin of this dark spot was ambiguous. This HiRISE image reveals that the dark color is likely the result of accumulations of basaltic sand (smooth, blue-colored material in the color swath) on top of otherwise relatively dust-free bedrock.<br><br>Evidence of layering is also visible within the dark (blue) area. There are alternating bands of lighter- and darker-toned material, consistent with alternating layers of bedrock. These alternating bands are not apparent outside of the dark area. This may mean that alternating layers of bedrock only occur within the dark area, or that these bedrock layers occur throughout the region but are covered and obscured by light-toned dust outside of the dark area.<br>
PSP_009505_1755	This observation covers the eastern portion of the proposed landing ellipse for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> (MSL) rover in Gale Crater.<br><br>The middle to bottom part of the image shows a dune field and exposures of light-toned layered material near the base of a very large layered mound in the center of Gale crater.

PSP_009523_2165	These features appeared in MOC Images R10-03225 and R16-01292.
PSP_009527_1670	This image shows an old volcano in Syria Planum, near the edge of the Tharsis volcanic rise. This is a region where extensive volcanism has occurred; in many places, the upper walls of Valles Marineris have cut through lava flows.  <br><br>The basic shape of the old volcano is visible here, but the entire region has been coated by dust. This makes it difficult to learn more about the volcanic processes that have occurred at this site. However, the mantle is interesting by itself. It has probably settled out of the atmosphere, either as dust or possibly volcanic ash, since it seems to coat the entire region uniformly. (Mars has frequent, massive dust storms which could create large deposits over time.) This mantle has a regular, scalloped texture that is visible at several scales.<br><br>The texture is not well understood; it is common in volcanic terrains, but also occurs on some other rock outcrops. HiRISE scientists are studying images like this one to determine how it forms. <br>
PSP_009535_2240	This image lies within the Deuteronilus Mensae region, located on the northern edge of Arabia Terra and borders the high-standing, heavily cratered Southern Hemisphere and the low, relatively uncratered, plains of the Northern Hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Deuteronilus Mensae is characterized by hills and mesas surrounded by broad debris aprons and this HiRISE image shows examples where lobate-shaped debris aprons appear to overlap.<br><br>There is zone of ridges that formed in an area where lobate debris aprons merged from different directions. A current hypothesis is that these ridges are expressions of compressional deformation between two lobes acting like a viscous fluid. One possibility, given the high latitude of the occurrence, is that the lobes of debris are ice-rich and flow somewhat like glaciers.<br><br>Recent results from the SHAllow RADar (<a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru_sharad.html'><strong>SHARAD</strong></a>) instrument, also onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, indicate that lobate debris aprons in Deuteronilus Mensae are composed of material dominated by ice (Plaut et al., 2008). This supports the  interpretation that these might be potential debris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers.<br><br>Some of the detailed textures on the surface of the debris aprons are commonly believed to be the result of ice loss due to sublimation (ice changing into water vapor). On Earth, debris-covered glaciers/rock glaciers typically develop wrinkles and fractures due to stresses in the ice as it flows. Where flows merge, they can buckle and push up ridges producing features similar to those visible here.<br>
PSP_009548_1420	Hellas Planitia is the low-lying plain on the floor of the Hellas Basin, an ancient impact crater over 2000 kilometers wide. This basin includes the lowest point on the surface of Mars. <br><br>A variety of unusual landforms occur on the floor of the basin due to the low elevation. One hypothesis is that Hellas may once have held lakes or seas, possibly with thick ice that might account for some of these features. <br><br>This image shows a small portion of western Hellas, in a region of enigmatic ridges. These ridges form an intricate pattern, enclosing kilometer-wide depressions. These strange features are still not well-understood; one possibility is that they formed in lake-bottom sediments when ice covering the lake touched bottom and shoved wet, loose material to the side. This HiRISE image reveals that the ridges contain many boulders; sediments deposited on the bottom of a lake might be fine-grained, although they may have hardened to rock later. The image also shows lineations, probably outcropping layers, running between the large ridges.<br><br>Because the resolution of HiRISE images is sufficient to see details such as the abundance of boulders and the presence of thin sedimentary layers, images of this and other poorly-understood terrains will be important in interpreting the geological and climatological history of Mars.<br><br>This observation is part of a stereo pair along with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007834_1420'><strong>PSP_007834_1420</strong></a>.

The suite of instruments on-board MSL could also help characterize the sulfate materials, which Opportunity has been studying since 2004. <br><br>This image is part of a stereo pair with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009497_1770'><strong>PSP_009497_1770</a></strong>.
PSP_009571_1755	This observation covers the eastern portion of the proposed landing ellipse for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> (MSL) rover in Gale Crater.<br><br>The middle to bottom part of the image shows a dune field and exposures of light-toned layered material near the base of a very large layered mound in the center of Gale crater. This image is part of a stereo pair with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009505_1755'><strong> PSP_009505_1755</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_009578_1715	Several valleys as well as light-toned material are visible in this HiRISE image of a portion of Allegheny Vallis along the plains west of Ganges Chasma.<br><br>The main valley, which starts in a pit called Ophir Cavus and extends for 155 kilometers into Ganges Chasma, is visible in the center of the image from left to right. Smaller and shallower valleys can be seen mostly to the north (top) of the image. The observation that there are several valleys here suggests that water flowed for some extended period of time or multiple times in order to change direction and produce different valleys. <br><br>Light-toned material is visible on the upper surfaces of the plains but not inside the valleys, perhaps because smaller amounts of water could interact with the lava plains at these higher elevations, while in the valleys larger amounts of flowing water eroded and removed the plains unit. The light-toned nature on the upper surfaces could have resulted from chemical alteration of the lava plains or deposition of evaporites as the water disappeared and left behind minerals once carried in the water.<br>
PSP_009601_1920	This image shows the edge of a layered shelf in a large impact crater. Sediments form a bench with a flat top and steep edge along part of the interior wall. This site shows part of the steep edge of those deposits. <br><br>The bench is formed by an upper layer that is relatively hard and resistant, while lower rocks are soft. Once the upper cap layer is removed, the weaker material below is easily eroded. This structure can be seen here: at the very top of the bench is a relatively steep lip, while material below has a muted appearance. A few steep outcrops lower on the slope suggest that there could be other strong layers. <br><br>Because of pervasive dust cover, it is difficult to learn much about the nature of the rocks here. Dust builds up by settling out after the many large Martian dust storms. (The dark streaks running downhill are seen in many dusty parts of Mars and are thought to be traces of dust avalanches). However, some small-scale structures are visible through the dust. Some fine layering is also visible, particularly near the base of the slope. The layers are probably still covered by dust, but not enough to completely obscure the underlying structure. <br>
PSP_009616_2035	Mawrth Vallis is an area on Mars that contains clay minerals that formed when water chemically altered the rocks. <br><br>There are four potential landing sites in the Mawrth Vallis region that are under consideration for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> rover, which is scheduled to launch in late 2009.  This image is taken just to the east of the third potential landing ellipse.  This observation shows a variety of scientifically interesting terrains and is also used to identify potential landing and driving hazards for the rover.<br>
PSP_009619_1630	This image shows a double impact crater in Syria Planum, and probably formed when a binary asteroid pair (two asteroids closely orbiting each other, while also orbiting the Sun) struck the surface. The asteroids must have been about the same size, on the order of a few hundred meters across, to produce these craters. <br><br>How is it possible to say that the double crater is due to a binary asteroid, instead of two independent impacts? Neither crater shows signs of burial by ejecta from the other. More importantly, the ejecta (material thrown out of the craters) shows signs of interacting; the ridges extending to the southeast of the crater probably formed when ejecta from the craters collided in midair, causing more debris to pile up at certain points. This means that the impacts occurred within moments of each other. <br><br>Ejecta interaction features like this can also form in association with ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù craters (craters made by debris from other impacts, rather than by asteroids), since many secondary craters form at once. In this case, however, a binary asteroid is the likely cause. The very large size is one indicator (secondary craters are generally much smaller than the ‚Äúprimary‚Äù crater), and there is not an obvious nearby source crater. While secondary craters are common, binary impacts are expected to occur as well, since binary asteroid pairs are observed. <br><br>This crater pair is also of geologic interest since it exposes a cross-section of the local rocks. Thin, flat layers are visible in the upper walls. Since this region has seen extensive volcanic activity, these may be a mix of old lava flows and other volcanic debris. Exposures like this provide evidence for the extent and thickness of these deposits. <br><br>
PSP_009623_1755	This image shows a fan of long raised ridges in the Aeolis region of Mars. These ridges are thought to be inverted stream channels, where formerly low-lying streambeds have been hardened and then turned into ridges when the surrounding material was eroded. This can occur if the stream deposited minerals, filling in pore spaces and hardening the streambed. <br><br>The assortment of ridges here is extremely complex, with strands cutting across each other. However, the actual stream system here could have been simpler, with ridges preserving different time periods in the history of the system. This possibility is supported by several sites where one ridge runs smoothly across another without disruption. One way for this to occur would be to have one streambed hardened and buried, with the stream subsequently changing course and cutting across its buried old route. <br><br>Although not all of the channels were active at once, this site clearly preserves a complex history, probably requiring thousands of years to form. <br>
PSP_009650_1755	This observation was taken on the western edge of the proposed landing ellipse for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> (MSL) rover in Gale Crater.<br><br>The top of the image shows a relatively smooth and boulder-free area for the rover to land and traverse safely. In the bottom half of the image, light-toned material, layered mounds, dunes and etched terrain are visible near the base of the large mound in the center of Gale Crater. <br><br>This is a stereo pair with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009716_1755'><strong>PSP_009716_1755</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_009654_2245	This crater with spectacular ejecta is located in the northern mid-latitudes in the Deuteronilus Mensae, located near the dichotomy boundary, where the southern highlands transition into the northern lowlands.<br><br>The crater has raised, fluidized ejecta. Scientists think that fluidized ejecta forms when an impact occurs into ice-rich material. The interior of the crater shows some material, particularly on the west wall, that has detached and is flowing into the crater center.  This suggests the presence of ground ice.<br><br>
PSP_009656_2780	Gypsum is a common water-based mineral found in evaporative beds (ancient lakes or seas) on Earth. Gypsum rarely occurs in sand dunes on Earth as it is water-soluble (dissolves in water). However, gypsum can be trapped in basins that have no water outlets or receive very light precipitation and form beautiful dunes. The White Sands National Monument in the Tularosa Basin, New Mexico, is the largest gypsum dune field in the world. <a href='http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEM117OFGLE_1.html'><strong>OMEGA,</strong></a> an instrument onboard the European Space Agency‚Äôs (ESA) Mars Express has detected gypsum deposits in the Martian north polar erg. <br><br>Where did the gypsum come from? Scientists propose that gypsum deposits formed as a result of melting or retreating ice sheets in a polar evaporate basal unit. In this image, gypsum may originate from the bright bedrock and may mix with saltating dark sand. However, the true source of the gypsum is still debated among planetary scientists.<br><br>The mafic (basaltic) dark dunes are predominately transverse with transitioning linear and barchanoid dunes with the wind coming from changing west-northwest and west-southwest directions. These dunes have several active processes occurring within them; grain avalanching is present at the crest of dunes and fading <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009656_2780_cut.jpg'><strong>dark slope streaks are visible</strong></a> on the slipface.<br><br>
PSP_009663_2635	The north polar layered deposits, and the bright ice cap that covers them, are very young (by geologic standards) features. To try and figure out the age of an area, or how quickly it's being resurfaced, planetary scientists count up the number of craters at different sizes. An older surface has more time to accumulate more craters whereas a younger surface, or one that has a lot of geologic activity that destroys craters, doesn't have many impact craters. <br><br>These polar deposits have a very low crater count so it is possible that the ice cap (bright white in this image) might only by about 10,000 years old and the surface of the layered deposits (orange-brown in this image) may be only a few million years old. This sounds like a long time but is very short compared to other surfaces on Mars.<br><br>HiRISE is enabling a more detailed study of these polar craters and the <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009663_2635_cut.jpg'><strong>target of this observation</strong></a> is visible in the center of the image. This crater proved to be a surprise in a few ways. Its shape is non-circular which is quite unusual for an impact crater. One possibility is that flow of the ice beneath the surrounding terrain has deformed the crater; however, ice-flow rates are thought to be very low on Mars today. <br><br>The crater also contains a patch of bright ice despite being surrounded by terrain that has mostly lost its ice cover. This seems typical for these polar craters and it may be that ice within these craters is protected from ablation by shading from the crater walls.<br>
PSP_009665_1525	This scene captures about half of a crater with an elongated rim. When craters form, they typically have a circular shape.  This crater has been modified since it formed, possibly by tectonic processes or excavation, although its raised rim indicates that these processes have not heavily eroded the rim since formation.<br><br>The terrain surrounding the crater consists of  megaripples, degraded craters, and rough terrain, possibly due to ancient lava flows from the nearby Hadriaca Patera. <br><br>Determining the age of these features and the processes that formed them may be possible; one such process is the interaction between the ripples and bedrock. The transverse aeolian ripples (TARs)with a N-S wind direction appear to be lithified because the rugged bedrock, impact craters, and ejecta overlay the ripples, indicating that the ripples are older. In the larger craters, brighter (possibly newer) ripples suggest a dominant wind direction from the northwest.<br><br>
PSP_009669_1500	This image shows the southeast rim of a large degraded crater where a valley breaches the crater rim. The valley itself, no longer pristine, is difficult to locate in the image.<br><br>However, it appears to be in the center <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009600_009699/PSP_009669_1500/PSP_009669_1500_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>near the right of the crater rim.</strong></a> It is possible that this valley transported water into the crater forming a lake in the ancient past.  <br><br>The scene is peppered with craters of various sizes and states of degradation, indicating that the surface is not young. A few craters are young enough to still have raised rims. One of these, located on the floor of the larger crater, has distinct raised ejecta radiating out from it.<br><br>The crater also has dunes on its floor, indicating that aeolian (wind) processes have modified it since it formed.<br><br>
PSP_009677_2135	Bacolor Crater is a pristine crater in the northern hemisphere. The linear striations at the top and bottom of the image are from the blast of the formation impact. This crater has a central peak other mounds and terraces on its floor. All of these features appeared during the final stages of crater formation.<br><br>The north wall of the crater has landslides which have sculpted the crater rim. The south wall has gullies, thought to form by fluvial processes. The gullies here are more incised (cut into the slope) than the landslides are.
PSP_009694_1545	These two craters show distinct bright layers around their rims. The crater on the top formed after the other, and its rim is sharp and less degraded, showing that it is younger. <br><br>At the juncture of the two craters is a landslide (<a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009600_009699/PSP_009694_1545/PSP_009694_1545_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>flowing into the top crater</strong></a>) that probably formed during the late stages of the top crater‚Äôs own formation or perhaps shortly after that.<br><br>The material that looks rough surrounding both craters is called ejecta, which is material that the impacts excavated.<br>
PSP_009696_2575	This polar terrain is located near the north pole. The bright patch of material is ice, which might have been deposited in the previous winter.<br><br>After ice in the form of surface frost is deposited from the atmosphere, it experiences changes throughout the Martian year. Some of the ice has a polygonal texture which probably formed when temperature variations created stress and cracks in the ice.<br><br>The dark features scattered throughout the scene are dunes. The streaks emanating from the dunes trending in the southwest direction indicate the dominant direction of the wind in recent times.<br><br>
PSP_009706_2125	The central portion of this image includes a portion of a valley network in Arabia Terra. In lower resolution images, this meander (a bend in a valley) appeared discontinuous - hence its selection as a target for HiRISE. However, at HiRISE resolution the valley is visible throughout its course. <br><br>This is a mid-latitude scene where ground ice is believed to be stable relatively near the surface today. The mottled terrain visible throughout the image could be a sublimation texture. Sublimation occurs when ice goes directly to the gas phase. When this happens, the space beneath the subsurface that the ice previously occupied is now empty, allowing the remaining surface to collapse and form the observed texture. <br><br>Several of the craters in this scene have flattened appearances, which may have resulted from ice-rich material being driven by gravity into the crater centers.<br><br>
PSP_009708_1770	This image is one of the proposed landing sites for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> (MSL) and is located in southern Meridiani Planum (to the south of the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landing site).<br><br>The image shows fairly smooth plains with small ripples, suggesting that wind is an active process here.

However, upon closer examination, the image reveals rocky outcrops at the top of some of the hills. These rocks contain clues pointing to a watery past.<br><br>This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009708_2205_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage</strong></a> (375x250 meters, or 410x273 yards) of the HiRISE <a href='http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/education/compositor/'><strong>false-color</strong></a> image depicts in detail the rocky layers in one of these hills.<br><br><a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a>, another of the instruments onboard <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru.html'><strong>Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter</strong></a>, has acquired data over this same region showing that the rocky outcrops contain clays. Clays of similar composition form in terrestrial environments favorable for life, where volcanic rocks are in close contact with water.<br>
PSP_009709_1810	Hydraotes Chaos is an equatorial region of chaotic terrain located near some of the large outflow channels on Mars. Chaotic terrain near the outflow channels (ancient flood channels) is thought to form when ices beneath the surface rapidly become liquid or gaseous and escapes, and the remaining solid material collapses.<br><br>Chaotic terrain is called ‚Äúchaotic‚Äù because it consists of a large jumble of randomly shaped mesas (hills) and troughs. Many regions of chaotic terrain are located at the head (start) of the outflow channels, suggesting that the origins of the two classes of feature might be related to each other.<br><br>The mesa located in the center of the image has elongated depressions that might be evidence of past fluvial activity.<br><br>
PSP_009709_2155	This scene in the Acidalia Planitia contains a variety of features, the most prominent of which are two mesas (hills).<br><br>Several craters in the scene have bright material extending outward <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009709_2155_cut.jpg'><strong>from their bottom left rims</strong></a>. These are wind streaks that mark the most recent dominant wind direction. The wind blows material out of the craters onto the adjacent plains. <br><br>At the bottom of the image are a cluster of craters. These might be secondary craters, which formed when ejecta from one impact hit the surface moving fast enough to create more craters. Secondary craters are identified partly by their occurrence in clumps and similar relative ages because all secondary craters from a single impact form at the same time.<br>
PSP_009716_1755	This observation was taken on the western edge of the proposed landing ellipse for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory </strong></a> (MSL) rover in Gale Crater.<br><br>The top of the image shows a relatively smooth and boulder-free area for the rover to land and traverse safely. In the bottom half of the image, light-toned material, layered mounds, dunes and etched terrain are visible near the base of the large mound in the center of Gale Crater. <br><br>This is a stereo pair with <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009650_1755'><strong> PSP_009650_1755</strong></a>.<br>
PSP_009717_2545	This image features arcuate ridges in the high northern plains. It has been suggested that arcuate ridges were formed by ancient glaciers on Mars. <br><br>The plains surrounding the arcuate ridges have two textures. The plains on the left half of the image have linear streaks trending from the top to the bottom. These might have been caused by wind moving material. The plains on the right side have more of a pitted texture that was probably caused by the removal of ground ice. <br><br>There are two craters in the center of the image. One formed on top of a ridge, while the other (faint circular feature) appears to be getting exposed by erosion.<br>
PSP_009719_2230	This observation shows fretted terrain in valleys located in Protonilus Mensae near the crustal dichotomy, the region that separates the southern hemisphere highlands from the northern hemisphere lowlands.<br><br>Fretted terrain is thought to involve movement of ice-rich material in its formation. The speckled texture of the valley fill (the fretted terrain) is probably due to sublimation, when ice goes directly from a solid to a gas, leaving behind empty space under the soil into which overlying material can collapse.<br><br>The linear striations in the valley fill mark the direction of movement. For example, in the valley near the top of the image, the material was moving across the scene (probably to the right based on images from other datasets). Also in this scene, are several small craters in various stages of degradation.
PSP_009721_1785	This image shows a portion of Uzer Crater, located in Sinus Meridiani near the equator in the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Light-toned layered rocks are visible <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009721_1785_cut.jpg'><strong>on the wall of Uzer Crater</strong></a>. Differences in color highlight variations in the layered units. Wind erosion, in particular, has modified the layers since exposure creating rounded depressions. These layers are interpreted to be an outcrop of sedimentary rocks that formed by sediments once deposited in this area. The origin of the sediments composing the layers is unknown but may have included fluvial processes and wind blown particles such as dust or volcanic ash.<br><br>Over time, the sediments were solidified into rock and eventually exposed when an impact formed Uzer Crater. Northern Sinus Meridiani has many similar outcrops of light-toned sedimentary material that are observed over a large region. <br><br>On Mars, as on Earth, sedimentary rocks preserve a record of past environments. HiRISE color images <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009721_1785_cut.jpg'><strong>reveal details in the layers</strong></a> that will help scientists learn more about their origin.<br><br>
PSP_009729_1735	This image shows the southwest region of a degraded crater‚Äôs floor, located near the equator.<br><br>The high-standing ridge near the bottom of the scene is a terrace that slumped off the crater‚Äôs rim (located just south of this image). The bumpy terrain near the top of the image is also material that has slumped off the crater rim.<br><br>The center of the image contains a terraced fan. The fan emanates from a valley (not pictured, located left of the scene) that intersects the crater‚Äôs south rim, which suggests that the valley might have transported fluid, likely water, into the crater. If this happened, then the fan marks where the flow deposited its sediment.
PSP_009739_2580	This observation shows linear dunes in the north polar region of Mars. Linear or longitudinal sand dunes are elongated, sharp crested ridges that are typically separated by a sand‚Äìfree surrounding surface.<br><br>These features form from bi-directional winds and extend parallel to the net wind direction. In this case, the net wind direction appears to be from the west-southwest. Linear sand dunes are found in many different locations on Earth and commonly occur in long parallel chains with regular spacing.<br><br>Superimposed on the surface of the linear dunes are smaller secondary dunes or ripples. This is commonly observed on terrestrial dunes of this size as well. Polygons formed by networks of cracks cover the substrate between the linear dunes and may indicate that ice-rich permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is present or has been present geologically recently in this location.<br>
PSP_009777_1955	The purpose of this observation was to monitor changes in bright wind streaks near the feature Tharsis Tholus. On Mars, aeolian activity is the most dynamic geologic process that shapes land formations. Wind streaks in particular, are some of the most prominent aeolian features on the surface of Mars and occur because of wind erosion, then deposition. These streaks help to determine surface wind circulation patterns and directions.<br><br>There are two main types of wind streaks: bright and dark. On this image there are bright wind streaks, which can be seen at the edges of most of the craters. There are a few craters that appear to be almost completely erased by dust on the surface, which has been blown into them. Bright wind streaks are thought to be depositional features that are made from fine, bright dust. On another note the removal of bright wind streaks, results in dark streaks.<br><br>Another significant feature on this image is the mini fossae. A fossae is a long, narrow, shallow depression. One explanation for fossae formations is volcanic activity. These channels (fossae) like this one can be interpreted as an ‚Äúunroofed‚Äù or collapsed lava tube. <br><br>Note: this caption was written by student Cynthia Inman.
PSP_009799_2205	This image shows lineated valley fill and lobate debris aprons in the Deuteronilus Mensae region. Deuteronilus Mensae is located on the northern edge of Arabia Terra and borders the high-standing, heavily-cratered southern hemisphere and the low, uncratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere of Mars. The region is characterized by hills and mesas surrounded by debris slopes and broad valleys.<br><br>Many of the valley floors in the Dueteronilus Mensae region exhibit complex alignments of small ridges and pits often called ‚Äúlineated valley fill.‚Äù The cause of the small-scale texture is not well understood, but may result from patterns in ice-rich soils or ice loss due to sublimation (ice changing into water vapor). The linear alignment may be caused by downhill movement of ice-rich soil or by glacial flow. For example, flowing ice on Earth typically develops wrinkles or ridges and pits due to stresses in the ice as it moves. The result is flow patterns, called ‚Äústream lines‚Äù that follow the valleys and curve around obstacles. In this image, stream lines are diverted or curve around the mesas.<br><br>The mesas in this image are also surrounded by aprons of debris that appear to have flowed away from the mesa. Recent results from the SHAllow RADar (<a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mro/mission/sc_instru_sharad.html'><strong>SHARAD</strong></a>) instrument, another instrument onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, indicate that lobate debris aprons in Deuteronilus Mensae, similar to those visible here, are composed of material dominated by ice [Plaut et al., 2008] and are interpreted to be potential debris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers. The debris aprons in this image appear to lie on top of the lineated valley fill and are therefore probably younger deposits.<br><br>
PSP_009841_1530	This image shows a beautifully preserved alluvial fan located on the southern interior wall of Holden Crater.<br><br>The ridges on the fan surface radiate from the apex and are <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009149_1750'><strong>"inverted channels"</strong></a> that once supplied the fan with sediment. The scalloped distal edges show an impressive cross-section through a layered sequence providing scientists with insight into the geologic history of this crater and climate conditions on early Mars. <br><br>As detailed by Grant et al. (Geology, 2008) from previously released adjacent images (<a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530'><strong>PSP_003077_1530</strong></a>, <a href='http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003644_1530'><strong>PSP_00344_1530</strong></a> and others), Holden provides evidence for two very different types of water-rich depositional environments on ancient Mars. The older, lower layers in the fan are thin, continuous and clay-rich and were likely deposited in long-standing body of water.  By contrast, the younger units at the top of the fan are very jumbled and are characteristic of sediment that was deposited in shorter-lived, higher-energy floods. <br><br>Holden Crater is one of six remaining landing site candidates for NASA's <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> rover, a mission scheduled for launch in 2011.
PSP_009842_1755	A pit on the floor of a trough west of Juventae Chasma exposes a concentric, laterally continuous, light- and intermediate-toned layered deposit that is eroding to form knobs and ridges. <br><br>The walls of the trough‚Äîalso exhibiting layering consisting of darker, thicker and blockier material‚Äîare shedding boulder-sized blocks down the slopes. The surface of the higher, surrounding plains also shows evidence of light-toned layering that is exposed beneath an eroding intermediate-toned, scabby surface.<br>
PSP_009855_2625	The north polar layered deposits (NPLD) are composed of a stack of ice-rich layers that is up to several kilometers thick. Each layer is thought to contain information about the climate that existed when it was deposited, so the stack of layers within the NPLD may represent a record of how climate has varied on Mars in the recent past.<br><br>We can see these internal layers exposed in the many troughs and scarps that have been cut by erosion into the stack. One of these troughs, visible in this image, contains a 500 meter (1640 feet) thick section of this layering.<br><br>However, the layers are not the only interesting thing being shown here. There is a conical mound part-way down the slope that is approximately 40 m (130 ft) high. One possible explanation for this anomaly is that it may be the remnant of a buried impact crater that is now being exhumed. As the NPLD accumulated, impacts occurred throughout its surface which were then buried by additional ice. These buried craters are generally inaccessible to us, but in a few rare locations, erosion that forms a trough (like this one) can uncover these buried structures. For reasons that are poorly understood right now, the ice beneath the site of the crater is more resistant to this erosion, so when material is removed in forming the trough the ice beneath the old impact site remains, creating this isolated hill.<br><br>An inspection of the full-resolution data shows that polygonal blocks, up to 10 m (33 feet) across, make up this mound. Although covered with reddish dust, the blocks resemble ice-rich blocks seen in other exposures of the NPLD.<br>
PSP_009881_1670	This image shows part of the wall of a large impact crater in Capri Mensa, a broad plateau on the floor of eastern Valles Marineris. The crater has excavated some of the sedimentary rocks and exposes layers in the walls. <br><br>Several rock units can be distinguished in the HiRISE <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_009800_009899/PSP_009881_1670/PSP_009881_1670_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>enhanced-color data.</strong></a> The topmost unit is thin, smooth, and appears dark blue; it has been eroded away in places. Just below this is a blocky or rubbly layer, that appears brown and is occasionally interbedded with light-toned blocky rocks. The lower parts of the slope are mostly light-toned rock with a faceted or scalloped appearance.<br><br>In other outcrops observed by HiRISE, these characteristics are associated with dusty material, probably deposited by the wind. The lower slopes have been partially blanketed and armored by material falling from above, so only patches of the light rocks are exposed. <br><br>The crater floor also contains intriguing rocks, including what appears to be megabreccia--large, broken clasts (pieces of rock) surrounded by a matrix of finer material. Megabreccia forms in energetic events, like impacts or large landslides, and could have been excavated by the present crater. This indicates another part of the complex story told by the rocks here. <br><br>
PSP_009905_2650	This image shows a steep, layered slope and flatter, dune-covered plains in Mars‚Äô north polar region. The layers are composed of varying contents of water ice and dust.<br><br>On Earth, icy layers like these in Greenland and Antarctica are important because they contain a record of past climate conditions. By looking at the detailed sequence of polar layers on Mars, scientists hope to be able to discover the types of variations that Mars‚Äô climate may have experienced. The lowest section in the stack of light layers is noticeably darker because of the presence of dark, sandy material. Erosion of this dark material is thought to provide the sand making up the large dunes on the plains.<br><br>Several exceptionally well-developed barchan (crescent-shaped) dune forms up to approximately 50 meters (160 feet) across are present in the center of the image.<br><br>
PSP_009913_1910	This image shows an example of ‚Äúen echelon‚Äù fractures in the Cerberus Fossae region. The fractures formed tectonically, by movement of Mars‚Äô crust. En echelon means that the fractures are laterally displaced from each other in a way consistent with the lateral displacement of other fractures in the same area.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009913_1910_cut.jpg'><strong>The colors in this enhanced color image</strong></a> result from differences in composition of the materials and do not represent how it would appear to the human eye.  Note that one can make out boulders and small dunes at the bottom of these fractures and layering within the walls.  Just visible at the top of the image is well-preserved impact crater ejecta. The image is 1.2 kilometer across.
PSP_009927_1750	Gale Crater contains a massive central mound of layered material that has an average vertical thickness of almost 4 kilometers (2.4 miles), making it more than twice as thick as the layers exposed along the Grand Canyon on Earth. Gale Crater is approximately 152 km in diameter.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009927_1750_cut.jpg'><strong>The subimage</strong></a> is a small portion of a HiRISE image detailing the fine-scale layering evident in the upper mound. The layered deposits can be divided into two types: a lower mound with near-horizontal, flat layers, and an upper mound with more numerous, thinner layers (some of which have greater degree of tilt than the lower layers).<br><br>The origin of these thin, repetitive layers is unknown, but they likely reflect environmental changes that occurred while the layers were being deposited. Today, erosion by wind scour has shaped them into the stair-step pattern that is reminiscent of parts of the American southwest.<br>
PSP_009929_2020	This image covers a flat plain in the Nili Fossae region of Mars. The portion shown here is roughly 400 meters, or 1/4 mile, across.<br><br>Bright, fractured bedrock is visible underlying dunes or ripples of wind-blown sand. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009929_2020_cut.jpg'><strong>The parallel, dark blue curves</strong></a> across the bedrock surface (underneath the dunes) are the edges of successive rock layers. These may appear dark blue because dark sand has become trapped at the edges of the layers. Successive layers in the bedrock are also exposed in the walls of degraded impact craters elsewhere in the image.<br><br>The layered rocks here are billions of years old, and infrared spectra from the <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM instrument</strong></a> have inferred that they contain minerals such as clays and carbonate that likely formed when liquid water chemically altered these rocks. This evidence for past water activity, combined with the general flatness of this particular location, make it a good candidate landing site for future Mars rover missions.<br><br>
PSP_009942_2645	Impact craters on the surface of Planum Boreum, popularly known as the north polar cap, are rare.  This dearth of craters has lead scientists to suggest that these deposits may be geologically young (a few million years old), not having had much time to accumulate impact craters throughout their lifetime. <br><br>It is also possible that impacts into ice do not retain their shape indefinitely, but instead that the ice relaxes (similar to glass in an old window), and the crater begins to disappear. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009942_2645_cut.jpg'><strong>This subimage shows an example of a rare,</strong></a> small crater ( approximately 115 meters, or 125 yards, in diameter). Scientists can count these shallow craters to attain an estimate of the age of the upper few meters of the Planum Boreum surface.<br><br>The color in the enhanced-color example comes from the presence of dust and of ice of differing grain sizes. The blueish ice has a larger grain size than the ice that has collected in the crater. The reddish material is dust. The smooth area stretching to the upper right, away from the crater may be due to winds being channeled around the crater or to fine-grained ice and frost blowing out of the crater.<br>
PSP_009966_1735	This image shows wind-eroded layered deposits in Aeolis Mensae. Aeolis Mensae is located close to the volcanic region of Elysium and near the boundary of the high-standing, heavily cratered southern hemisphere and the low, sparsely-cratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Aeolis Mensae is well-known for its unusual features commonly related to wind activity on the planet‚Äôs surface. <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_009966_1735_cut.jpg'><strong>Near the bottom of the image</strong></a> is a long, sinuous, flat-topped feature that has been exposed by wind erosion. This sinuous ridge is one of several similar ridges in the region that are believed to be former stream channels now preserved in inverted relief.<br><br>On Earth, inverted relief occurs when formerly low-lying areas become elevated because the original depression is filled with materials, such as lava, that are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. In the case of stream channels, the streambed may contain larger rocks and/or sediments that have been cemented by chemicals precipitating from flowing water that remain, while adjacent fine material is blown away by the wind. In this location, it is most likely that water once flowed through this channel and deposited sediments that eventually filled the channel and became cemented. Over time, wind eroded the surrounding surface leaving the remnant channel exposed as a raised flat-topped ridge.<br><br>On either side of the inverted channel and throughout the image are several linear, streamlined ridges oriented roughly south to north. These are yardangs, streamlined remnants of material shaped by the action of sand-blown sediments that eroded away weaker material. Landforms such as these are common in desert areas on Earth.  The orientation of the yardangs indicates the primary wind direction.<br><br>
PSP_009985_1770	Miyamoto Crater has been studied in great detail as a potential landing site for the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory rover.</strong></a> This area of the crater contains a diverse collection of rocks, including clay-like minerals, and other types of minerals called chlorides, sulfates and iron oxides.<br><br>The chemical compositions of these rocks suggest that they formed as sediment accumulated in ancient rivers and shallow lakes. An example of rocks that formed from river sediment is visible in the northern part of this image. Here, a somewhat wavy ridge of rock is apparent. This ridge is interpreted to be an ancient riverbed.<br><br>Water flowing along the river carried sediment, small particles of rock and dissolved chemicals that settled to the bottom of the river channel. Over time, the river dried up and this loose sediment at the bottom of the channel turned into rock. The soil surrounding this ancient river channel was slowly blown away by the wind, leaving behind these ridges of rock where the river once flowed.<br><br>Similar inverted river channels are being studied on Earth in order to understand more fully how and why they form. Inverted river channels on Earth preserve organic material, including fossils, and therefore similar features on Mars are important sites for investigating the planet‚Äôs past potential for habitability.<br><br>
PSP_010008_2630	This image shows an exposure of the north polar layered deposits (NPLD) within the northern residual ice cap. The polar layered deposits are thought to have been formed by recent climate changes on Mars, like ice ages on Earth. <br><br>Scientists are studying the NPLD to learn more about these climate changes on Mars. In many places, the NPLD layers appear to extend over large areas, suggesting that they were deposited from atmospheric suspension. If the layers in this image are horizontal and continuous, the apparent curves are caused by erosion of valleys into the NPLD. To determine whether this is the case, HiRISE has acquired two images of this location to form a stereo pair. Analysis of this stereo pair will allow the orientation and thickness of the layers to be measured across the region of stereo coverage, constraining hypotheses for their formation.<br><br>Also visible in this image are bright and dark streaks that may be caused by the redistribution of frost by winds.<br>
PSP_010012_2225	Impact craters are sometimes nicknamed 'Mother Nature's drill holes' because, thanks to them, deep rock formations are exposed at the surface. Bonestell Crater is a good example.<br><br>This image depicts part of the floor of this relatively young impact crater located in the <a href='http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/mission/images/PIA02820_mola.jpg'><strong>Northern Lowlands</strong></a>. The Northern Lowlands occupy most of the northern half of Mars. They are younger than the Southern Highlands, as shown by the lower number of impact craters, and well below the planet's average elevation. Their origin is still a mystery.<br><br>Bonestell is 42 kilometers (26 miles) in diameter and 1,250 meters (4,100 feet) deep.  The rocky hills on the floor of this crater constitute its 'central peak'. Central peaks form due to <a href='http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/milk_drop_falling_into_reservoir_of_milk_4_9_harold_edgerton/objectview_enlarge.aspx?page=510&sort=3&sortdir=asc&keyword=&fp=502&dd1=0&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=0&oID=190034971&vT=1'><strong>elastic rebound</strong></a> of subsurface materials immediately after impact. The rocks in Bonestell's central peak may have been 4-to-8 km below the surface before impact.<br><br>This <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010012_2225_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage</strong></a> (437x500 m or 479x547 yards; 11 Mb) of the HiRISE image shows a portion of Bonestell's central peak. HiRISE reveals details in the structure and color of these deep rocks that will help scientists decipher the origin and history of the Northern Lowlands.<br><br>
PSP_010027_1745	This image shows layered sedimentary deposits in Candor Mensa, a broad plateau of thickly stacked sedimentary rocks in Candor Chasma, part of the giant troughs of Valles Marineris.<br><br>Valles Marineris is a system of tectonic depressions formed by down-dropping faults; the floors are among the lowest points on the surface of Mars, and may have once held lakes. Some sites show evidence for streams or rivers. The troughs may have also been sites of volcanic activity. <br><br>Currently, the deep floors contain massive deposits of bright sedimentary rocks. Some of the deposits are several kilometers thick, and have diverse composition and appearance. They were probably formed by many different processes in different environments.  <br><br>At this site, most of the bright rocks exhibit a scalloped, patterned texture. This is thought to be associated with low-density deposits undergoing wind erosion, although the process is still not well-understood. Despite this relatively uniform texture, some variations are evident. The southern (upper) part of the deposit is relatively uniform, while the central portion appears to have thin layers. <br><br>On close inspection, the layers near the center of the image are all composed of the same material; they are probably visible due to slight topographic steps caused by variations in the strength of the rock. The layers have been highlighted by a mantle of dark, wind-blown sand ripples, which cover the flat parts of the stepped structure. At low resolution, this gives the appearance of alternating light and dark layers. <br><br>In the northernmost part of the image, the sediments have an entirely different texture, ranging from massive to fractured. These sediments also show evidence of layering.<br><br>Interpretation of these sediments is complicated by younger mantling materials. In addition to the sand ripples (some of which may have hardened to rock), a relatively massive dark layer appears to cap or drape the deposit in many places, including the southern part of this image.<br>
PSP_010034_2250	This image shows a typical landscape from the far western part of Utopia Planitia in the Northern lowlands of Mars.<br><br>These areas are characterized by a network of polygonal cracks and elongated, scallop-shaped depressions.  The cracks are similar to thermal contraction cracks in periglacial and alpine regions on Earth formed  by seasonal contraction of the permafrost (permanently frozen ground).  In cold regions of Earth, polygonal cracks like this usually indicate ground ice.<br><br>The scalloped depressions (or "scallops") generally have a steep "pole-facing" scarp and a gentle "equator-facing" slope. Scallop formation may be due to the degradation of ice-rich subsurface material by sublimation (process of ice going directly from a solid state to a gas state). On scallop floors, we often see nested series of curvilinear ridges that probably point to earlier locations of the scarp and contribute to the "shell-like" appearance.<br><br>Scallops are observed in other areas of the Martian mid-latitudes (40 to 60 degrees) in both northern and southern hemispheres. They probably represent a form of degradation that erodes an ice-rich mantle thought to have been deposited by precipitation during periods of high obliquity (the tilt of the Martian axis of rotation relative to the plane of Mars' orbit). These features add weight to the evidence that water ice has been a dynamic component of the Martian sub-surface during recent geological ages and they they may slowly be continuing their development at the present time.<br><br>
PSP_010045_1880	This observation shows small, branching channels that are part of the larger Athabasca Valles channel system.<br><br>These side channels are ‚Äúdistributaries‚Äù because they bifurcate from the main channel, which is located to the northwest of this image. The distributaries flowed from north to south when they were active.<br><br>Despite having pronounced topography, nearly all the terrain in this image is covered by a thin carapace of solidified lava. Long ago, the lava erupted from a fissure at the head of Athabasca Valles. It flooded this region and then receded, leaving behind only a thin coating. At higher elevations, the lava has a finely ridged but otherwise smooth texture, whereas on the floors of the distributary channels, it exhibits arcuate pressure ridges (that is, ridges formed by the compression, buckling and breaking of the lava flow surface) as well as a polygonal texture that bears a superficial resemblance to scaly reptile skin.<br><br>Small mounds and pitted cones dot the surface of the lava in the southern part of this HiRISE image. These are thought to be ‚Äúrootless cones‚Äù that formed where steam explosions disrupted the lava flow.<br>
PSP_010052_1560	Eberswalde Crater is an approximately 65-kilometer diameter, closed basin crater. It contains a delta, which indicates that flowing water was present for an extended period of time in the past.<br><br>Parts of the crater have inverted channels that have higher relief because a more resistant material was deposited in the channel and therefore it was less susceptible to erosion than the surrounding area. The image also shows resistant knobs and mounds as well as a scoured surface. <br><br>The <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> instrument on-board MRO has detected phyllosilicates (clays) in some of the bright layers here. On Earth, clays form in the presence of water, so this is more evidence that there was a persistent flow of water in Eberswalde. <br>
PSP_010057_2040	This image shows two features of interest on the floor of a large impact crater. The first is the set of roughly parallel ridges on the crater floor that point towards the crater center north of the image. These may be inverted stream channels, where old streambeds became resistant to erosion due to cementation or simply deposition of large rocks.  This is consistent with the slightly wavy, sinuous shape of the ridges, but these examples are not particularly well-preserved. <br><br>More recently, this site has become blanketed by dust, settling out after global dust storms. This obscures much of the fine-scale geology, but allows HiRISE to see the effects of a recent process: dust devils. These have left the dark stripes across the surface by disturbing the dust cover. Most followed straight paths, but a few loops or turns are visible. Dust devils may be an important factor in the Martian climate system because they lift dust into the atmosphere, helping to trigger larger dust storms. <br><br>
PSP_010071_2615	In this enhanced-color image are dunes within the largest collection of dunes on Mars, Olympia Undae, near the margin of the north polar deposits, Planum Boreum. <br><br>This section of Olympia Undae is particularly interesting because the dunes are rich in gypsum, a mineral that forms in the presence of water. The material comprising these dunes is thought to have eroded from geologic units near the base of the polar deposits, but these units have poor to no gypsum content. Therefore, water likely affected these dunes after the sand had eroded out from the polar deposits. Several ideas have been proposed to explain the formation of gypsum, including hydrothermal (hot water) activity and melting of water-ice in the polar deposits.<br><br>While gypsum dunes on Earth (for example, at White Sands, New Mexico) are white (the color of gypsum), these Martian dunes are dark due to the presence of basaltic grains that lower the brightness of the dunes. <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM,</strong></a> another instrument on MRO, has found that the crests of the dunes are the most gypsum-rich.<br><br>So, what is the bright, polygonally-fractured material in the low spaces between the dunes? Perhaps it is polar ice lying beneath, desiccated (dried) gypsum material whose fine grain size makes it difficult for CRISM to detect, or something else altogether.<br>
PSP_010077_2520	This image is a section of an impact site in the Acidalia Planitia albedo region of Mars.<br><br>In several areas, material has been pulled down by gravity and weathering due by wind mainly in the crater walls. This has caused small, observable avalanches and has created channels of material descending down into the crater. Located at the bottom of the image is a section of slightly elevated terrain, possible central uplift from the impact crater. Situated on the central uplift is a well matured dune field. The slopes of the crater walls contain less developed dunes. <br><br>A field of barchan-type dunes is located on the up lift at the bottom of the image. Judging by the orientation the dunes, the wind is coming from the southwest. At the base of the uplift there is a field of transverse dunes. They also spread into the valleys of the barchan-type dunes. The crater walls also contain linear ripples and have loose material avalanching down them. These are less developed than the dunes near the southern field. The disruptions may occur in the dune fields as a result of movement of material down the crater wall by avalanching. Combined with the wind, this causes the ripples to be constantly developing and reforming. <br><br>Note: this caption was written by William Lucas.
PSP_010086_2615	The polar deposits of Mars are among the most geologically active on the planet today. This image illustrates several processes affecting the polar landscape both today and in the recent past.<br><br>Frost streaks cross this image from upper left to lower right and are a testament to the power of the wind to redistribute material in this region. In the center of the image lies an impact crater about 130 meters across (425 feet). Craters on the polar deposits are rare because the very active surface processes remove them quickly. This particular crater is likely to have been formed less than 100,000 years ago, which is very recent in geologic terms. Streaks of material emanating from the crater rim have been created as the ice and dust being transported across the surface by the wind encounters that obstacle.<br><br>Although its initial depth was probably about 25 m (80 ft), the crater has been infilled with ice and dust and is now quite shallow. However, in one portion of the crater (lower right), the fill material has been removed, creating a pit adjacent to the crater wall. This pit contains a fresh deposit of ice and may be in the beginning stages of being infilled again. These cycles of infilling and erosion will eventually erase the crater from the landscape.<br><br>Scientists can examine many of these craters at different stages in their lifespan, from the very fresh to the almost erased. Using these data we can make estimates of how active this part of the martian surface is today. Of course we need to find these rare craters first! Craters this size are usually about 200 km (125 miles) apart in this region, with the intervening landscape being relatively featureless.<br>
PSP_010090_1255	Spring is already starting to show its influence at the Russell Crater field of sand dunes. Channels down the face of the largest dune show dark spots where the sublimation of the seasonal carbon dioxide ice cap has begun.<br><br>This active process (where ice evaporates directly to gas) dislodges loose material, leaving dark streaks down steep slopes. The process starts when the sun peeks above the horizon at the end of antarctic night. Bright streaks may be loose frost cascading down steep slopes.<br>
PSP_010100_2165	This image of a crater in the Utopian region can be described as what happens when heat produced from an impact comes into contact with Marsí icy surface.<br><br>Since the surface temperature of Mars is well below the freezing point of water, Mars‚Äô soil is a mixture of soil and permafrost. When this impact occurred, a great deal of energy in the form of heat was released onto the surface, creating a melted feature in the bright icy soil. This melting and then refreezing of the ice (as the impact cooled) caused what is known as a periglacial formation. This is depicted towards the middle of the image where the ejecta blanket lays. <br><br>This is likely a geologically newer surface since the only impacts disrupting the image are a few small craters that are mostly towards the bottom left-hand side of the full image. The fact the ejecta blanket is still intact and not fully collapsed supports the idea that is it a newer surface feature as it has not been affected by erosional processes. <br><br>Note: this caption was written by student Laura Woodbury.
PSP_010169_2650	This image shows dark sand dunes in Chasma Boreale. Chasma Boreale is a giant trough that cuts into the north polar ice cap for 570 kilometers (350 miles) forming a broad valley bordered by stacked layers of ice. A portion of the north polar ice cap is visible at the northern edge of the trough in the <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_010100_010199/PSP_010169_2650/PSP_010169_2650_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>upper portion of the image.</strong> </a><br><br>Many dark toned sand dunes march down the trough under the winds‚Äô direction. The <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010169_2650_cut.jpg'><strong>sand dunes visible here</strong></a> are barchan dunes. Barchan dunes are also commonly found on Earth, and are crescent-shaped with a steep slip face bordered by horns oriented in the downwind direction. Barchan dunes form by uni-directional winds and thus are good indicators of the dominant wind direction. In this case, the dunes indicate that the direction of the strongest winds are parallel to the chasma walls, roughly east to west. The dark material composing the dunes could be volcanic ash or is possibly dark sand eroding out of the polar layered materials.<br><br>
PSP_010180_2645	This image shows a small impact crater on the bright north polar perennial ice cap. Mars has ice caps at both its north and south poles. The perennial, or permanent, portion of the north polar cap consists almost entirely of water ice. <br><br>The <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_0010180_2645_cut.jpg'><strong>impact crater is about 66 meters</strong></a> (215 feet) in diameter. Ejecta from this crater can be seen extending primarily to the northwest. The asymmetry in the crater ejecta can be an effect of atmospheric winds associated with the impact itself but, in this case, is most likely the result of an oblique impact (a low impact angle with respect to the horizontal). As impact angles decrease, the ejecta blanket is increasingly offset downrange.<br><br>The impactor that formed this crater approached the surface from the southeast.  The slightly elliptical shape of the crater is also a result of an oblique impact.<br><br>
PSP_010183_2035	This image covers part of a proposed rover landing site in the Mawrth Vallis region of Mars. The portion visible here is roughly 200 meters, or 650 feet, across, and shows an enhanced color view of light-toned rocks ranging in color from light blue to tan.<br><br>Polygonal fracture patterns (similar to a tiled floor) are visible on the surfaces of some of these rocks, and <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010183_2035_cut.jpg'><strong>yellow/brown ridges protruding from the surface</strong></a> may be composed of hard minerals or cemented sediments formed when water flowed through fractures in the ancient bedrock. Dark blue dunes or ripples of wind-blown sand are also visible on the surface here.<br><br>Elsewhere in the image, exposures of the light-toned rocks in the steep walls of impact craters reveal that these rocks are finely layered, similar to sedimentary rocks on Earth.  The orbiting infrared spectrometers <a href='http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMUC75V9ED_0.html'><strong>OMEGA</strong></a> and <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</a></strong> have demonstrated that these layered rocks contain clay minerals, which can only form in the presence of water. The different colors of the rocks typically reflect differences in composition, suggesting that multiple styles or episodes of water activity may be recorded in the rock record here.<br><br>These characteristics have made Mawrth Vallis a prime candidate landing site for future Mars rover missions, including NASA‚Äôs <a href='http://marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/'><strong>Mars Science Laboratory</strong></a> due to launch in 2009.<br><br>
PSP_010197_1540	This observation covers the Martian surface just to the east of the 150 kilometer-diameter Holden Crater in southwestern Margaritifer Terra.<br><br>The image reveals a very complex terrain, with what appear to be very blocky or polygonally fracture materials interspersed with other materials also standing in relatively high local relief. The entire surface appears etched and the blocky or fracture materials may lie on top of the sequence.<br><br>Although some of these materials likely relate to the ejecta deposit from Holden Crater, the complex appearance of the current surface makes mapping out those deposits difficult. This fascinating distribution of materials and landforms comprises a spectacular landscape the origin of which likely reflects contributions from multiple geologic processes.<br><br>
PSP_010198_2645	This image shows an example of layers in the Martian north polar deposits. These deposits, part of the Planum Boreum dome, are composed mainly of water ice and small amounts of dust.<br><br>The layers within these deposits are exposed by shallowly-sloping troughs that cut into them. This image is particularly interesting because it crosses complicated trough geometry, making the layers appear curved and exposing multiple stratigraphic levels.  <br><br>Note that layers of different thicknesses are visible. Layer thickness is directly related to the accumulation rate of the layer; a higher accumulation rate will lead to a thicker layer.  However, a myriad of factors work together to influence accumulation rate, such as the amount of sunlight reaching the surface and the amount of water in the contemporaneous atmosphere.  <br><br>This image, 1.2 kilometer in width (0.75 miles) <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_010100_010199/PSP_010198_2645/PSP_010198_2645_RGB.NOMAP.browse.jpg'><strong>shows enhanced color data.</strong></a> Redder areas have more dust, and the blueish-white areas have more ice; but much of the color may be due to dust and ice deposited on the wall of the trough, after the layers were exposed by trough formation (i.e., color may not directly relate to layer composition).<br><br>
PSP_010200_1805	Although most of the craters HiRISE usually images are ancient, impact cratering is an ongoing process on the Martian surface.<br><br>While very large craters are rare, smaller ones with diameters of a few meters form on timescales rapid enough for Mars missions to confirm the presence of a new crater. Data from the <a href='http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/'><strong>Mars Orbiter Camera</strong></a> (MOC) on the (now defunct) Mars Global Surveyor, the <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/'><strong>Context Camera</strong></a> (CTX) on MRO, and HiRISE have dated craters to within a few years or even months, based on repeat images that show no craters in the earlier image and craters present in the later image. <br><br>Most of the new craters identified by CTX and HiRISE have been located in Mars' dustiest areas, where a new impact will scour dust from the surface and reveal darker underlying rock. This color difference makes the craters easier to spot. Other, less dusty areas of Mars are certainly being bombarded as well, but the size of the craters makes them difficult to detect without stark color contrasts. Once a new dark spot has been identified by CTX, HiRISE will take a follow-up image to confirm that the dark spots are in fact impact craters. <br><br>Many of the newest craters are part of a crater cluster, <a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_010200_1805_cut.jpg'><strong>like this one</strong></a>. This cluster is about 350 meters (almost a quarter mile) across at its longest, and the largest crater in the image is 5 meters (16 feet) in diameter. These clusters likely result from breaking up of the impactor before it strikes the surface. How widely dispersed the craters are depends on the strength and density of the impactor. Scientists can study these clusters to learn more about the object that created them.<br><br>
PSP_010206_1975	This image captures a record of changing environments on ancient Mars, as recorded in the rock record at Nili Fossae.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010206_1975_cut.jpg'><strong>The subimage shows</strong></a> a rock type known as megabreccia, composed of numerous differently colored blocks, each up to 40 meters (130 feet) across, arranged in a seemingly disorganized array. Megabreccia forms when an energetic event, such as formation of an impact crater, breaks up pre-existing rocks and jumbles their fragments. Megabreccia is found in some of the most ancient rocks exposed on the Martian surface.<br><br>Elsewhere in the image are layered rocks, which have been shown by the orbiting spectrometers <a href='http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMUC75V9ED_0.html'><strong>OMEGA</strong></a> and <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</a></strong> to contain clay minerals. These minerals must have formed in the presence of water, and may have later been transported and deposited here in sedimentary layers. Most of the layers appear to overlie the exposures of megabreccia, but some megabreccia blocks are themselves internally layered, suggesting that sedimentary processes were active here early in Martian history.<br><br>Above the clay-bearing layers is a dark, rough-textured rock unit that was emplaced later. Geologic mapping of the Nili Fossae region has shown this deposit to be a lava flow from the Syrtis Major volcano to the south. The minerals detected in the lava flow suggest that liquid water had become rare on the Martian surface by the time the flow occurred.<br><br>
PSP_010219_2785	<a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010219_2785_cut.jpg'><strong>This enhanced-color close-up</strong></a> (1.2 kilometer across, 0.75 miles) shows an example of dunes in Abalos Undae.<br><br>The Abalos Undae dune field stretches westward, away from a portion (Abalos Colles) of the ice-rich north polar layered deposits that is separated from the main Planum Boreum dome by two large chasms. These dunes are special because their sands may have been derived from erosion of the Rupes Tenuis unit (the lowest stratigraphic unit in Planum Boreum, beneath the icier layers) during formation of the chasms. Some researches have argued that these chasms were formed partially by melting of the polar ice.  <br><br>The enhanced color data illuminate differences in composition. The dunes appear blueish because of their basaltic composition, while the reddish-white areas are probably covered in dust. Upon close inspection, tiny ripples and grooves are visible on the surface of the dunes; these features are formed by wind action, as are the dunes themselves.<br><br>It is possible that the dunes are no longer migrating (the process of dune formation forces dunes to move in the direction of the main winds) and that the tiny ripples are the only active parts of the dunes today.<br><br>
PSP_010221_1420	One of the most important processes on present-day Mars is wind. Aeolian (wind-related) features are found in most regions of the planet. This image shows a diverse array of such features: large dunes, small ripples, and dust-devil tracks (the dark, arcing structures on the dunes). <br><br>Dust devils form in many parts of Mars, but they are often particularly distinct on sand dunes. One possibility is that the dust devils dislodge a small amount of fine dust, making the color of dark sand more prominent. <br><br>Ripples of wind-blown sand form regular patterns. In the simplest case, wind blowing in a constant direction creates evenly spaced straight ripples at right angles to the wind. More complex wind patterns create more complex ripples, and in this scene variations from linear to polygonal to checkerboard patterns are visible. <br><br>This image is particularly interesting because of the occurrence of seasonal frost on the south-facing slopes. (The image is in the southern hemisphere, so south faces the pole and gets little winter light). <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010221_1420_cut.jpg'><strong>This is particularly apparent in the color swath,</strong></a> as the frost forms pale, purplish patterns. On the dunes, this highlights some of the regular patterns, as the frost forms only on parts of the ripples. The result is an intricately textured pattern of color.<br><br>
PSP_010222_1815	This observation shows part of a broad expanse of bare rock in Terra Meridiani. This is a large area with abundant sedimentary rocks forming a stack hundreds of meters thick, and now being eroded into a landscape reminiscent of the southwestern United States. <br><br>The timescale involved in depositing and eroding these layers is evident from the remnant impact craters preserved here. The large arc in the image is the rim of one crater; the smaller, circular dark spots are traces of other impacts. Light sediments are found both inside and outside the large crater, indicating that this crater formed during the period of sediment deposition. It is likely that this depression, which was probably more than a kilometer deep when it formed, was completely filled and buried and is now being exhumed. Crater densities are often used to estimate the age of surfaces on Mars, but here the rate of erosion is enough to erase small craters, reducing the apparent age of the surface. These rocks probably date from an early era of Martian history, but no fresh, pristine craters are visible. <br><br>The smaller circular patches are also impact craters seen somewhere in a complex cycle of burial and erosion. They are filled with dark material which probably mantled the region at one point, most likely after all of the light material was deposited. In some places this appears to have been hardened into rock, as in the large dark circle in the north-central part of the image. Material eroded from this hardened mantle may now be forming the ripples seen in many places as it is blown by the wind; the color of the ripples is similar to the slabs of dark mantle.  <br><br>At the finest scale, the light sediments are intricately textured. A diverse assortment of fine cracks called joints are visible. The scale and density of these joints varies across the image; this suggests variations in the properties of the rocks. Although the image as a whole is a relatively flat plain, at small scale the surface is intricately rough. The balance between erosion and rock strength has left a surface with many small knobs, mesas, cliffs, and bumpy textures. <br><br>Further evidence for the diversity of rocks here comes from the enhanced color. The dark mantling materials are generally blue in the RGB color image while the sediments are generally pale, but a diverse range of hues indicates variations in the composition (or in the amount of sand and dust trapped on the surface by textures of varying roughness). This helps to highlight layering and shows which rocks are most similar to each other.<br><br><br>
PSP_010269_1900	This observation shows lava-covered plains in the Elysium Planitia region of Mars, located near the equator.<br><br>Two distinct lavas are visible in this image. The darker lava to the north (top) is the edge of the youngest major lava flow on Mars; it was fed by a voluminous eruption that coursed through the Athabasca Valles channel system.<br><br>The lighter-toned lava that covers the remainder of this image is older and dustier. It has a striped appearance due to slender dunes or ripples composed of windblown materials that are oriented northwest-southeast.<br><br>The most prominent feature in this image is the discontinuous line of pits and troughs that <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_010200_010299/PSP_010269_1900/PSP_010269_1900_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>cuts across its center.</strong></a> It is an ancient volcanic fissure vent. Lava once erupted through this fracture onto the surface. The irregular depressions around the troughs may either be due to near-vent erosion by the lava or to the ponding and drain-back of the lava around the vent.<br><br>
PSP_010281_1510	This image covers a portion of the northeast inner wall of Columbus Crater, located in the southern hemisphere of Mars and is approximately 100 kilometers (60 miles) in diameter.<br><br>Layered sedimentary rocks are found on the crater walls and floor, and may have been deposited by water or by wind.  These rocks have subsequently been eroded to expose their successive layers in cross-section.  The near-infrared spectrometer <a href='http://crism.jhuapl.edu/'><strong>CRISM</strong></a> has revealed that these layers contain various hydrated minerals.<br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010281_1510_cut.jpg'><strong>Visible here</strong></a> is a north-facing slope (roughly 250 meters, or 800 feet, across) exposing finely layered sedimentary rock. In this false-color view, layers with a dark blue appearance may be intrinsically darker, or may have a texture that more effectively collects dark sand particles, than adjacent layers with a brighter appearance.
PSP_010334_1760	This image shows yardangs, or ridges formed from wind abrasion, in the southern Amazonis Planitia, which is located between the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces on Mars. <br><br>Yardangs typically form in dry, desert environments with strong prevailing winds that are unidirectional and carry an abrasive sediment load. Abrasive winds erode the surface into parallel elongate landforms, or ridges, that are often three or more times longer than they are wide. When viewed from above, these landforms resemble the hull of a boat. Yardangs typically form in easily-eroded material, most likely sedimentary rock or volcanic ash deposits that contain some amount of sand. Sometime after the formation of these landforms, they were covered by a relatively thin, uniform coating of dust giving the area a monotone appearance. Dark slope streaks, interpreted as forming by avalanching of the dry dust, are visible on several of the slopes.<br><br>Yardangs are found on both Earth and Mars and are common on Mars in the regions west and southwest of Olympus Mons, such as the area in this image in the southern Amazonis Planitia.<br><br>
PSP_010344_2655	Multiple levels within the north polar layered deposits are visible in this HiRISE image.<br><br>The north polar layered deposits (NPLD) are a stack of dusty water-ice layers that are thought to record information about past Martian climates in the same way that ice-caps on the Earth record variations in our climate. These Martian layers are visible in the walls of troughs and scarps eroded into the stack. One such scarp-face is visible on the far left <a href='http://hirise-pds.lpl.arizona.edu/PDS/EXTRAS/RDR/PSP/ORB_010300_010399/PSP_010344_2655/PSP_010344_2655_RED.abrowse.jpg'><strong>of the full image</strong></a> and decreases in height from left to right.<br><br>Scientists continue to debate the length of time required to accumulate this stack of layers with estimates ranging from a few million years to about a billion years. Although we donít yet know which layer corresponds to which time in Marsí history, we can still use these layers to try to understand how the climate has changed over this period.<br><br>The topmost layers, which are the most recent (far left of the image), are brighter and appear brownish in this false-color view. They are interpreted to be a mixture of water ice and dust. The lower layering is more complex and appears to be a mixture of bright whiteiish layers (that we think are ice) and dark blue-ish layers (which we think are mostly sand). A large pit in the center of the image penetrates deeply into this stack of layers and shows these alternating sandy and icy layers extending to depths of hundreds of meters (about 1000 feet).<br><br>Erosion of the dark sandy layers releases sandy material which collects into dunes such as the linear example that stretches across the middle of this image.<br>
PSP_010345_2150	This image shows two related features: a trough with a succession of pits in the center. The trough, formed by the roughly straight scarps trending NW-SE, is a graben, a tectonic feature formed when a block slides downwards along two faults facing each other. Graben are found in many places on Earth, with some of the best-known examples in the canyon lands area of southern Utah. <br><br>A succession of pit craters is found in the center of the graben. These are rimless pits, roughly circular, which form via collapse. On both Earth and Mars, they are commonly found in volcanic terrains. They may be due to collapse into void space left behind after propagation of a lava-filled dike.<br><br>An interesting aspect of this site is that some of the pit craters are nearly filled with some mantling material, while others have relatively smooth floors and appear empty. Since this material may have been deposited regionally, this suggests that the pits formed at different times.<br>
PSP_010354_2165	This highly modified crater is located in Arabia Terra at the boundary between the southern highlands and northern lowlands. The crater is intersected by one of the putative shorelines of the hypothesized ancient northern ocean.<br><br>It is in a region which has also been proposed to have younger Amazonian fluvial deposits. The south rim of the crater is additionally <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010354_2165_cut.jpg'><strong>cut by well-defined gullies</strong></a>.<br><br>The crater is filled with sediments, possibly fluvial or lacustrine in origin. They were probably emplaced in two or more separate episodes, as two different floor units are clearly visible, separated by a fractured zone. The erosion pattern of the mesa walls shows that the inner structure of the upper floor material is densely layered. The mass wasting (landslide) deposits from the mesas <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010354_2165_cut_b.jpg'><strong>superimpose the aeolian ripples</strong></a>, suggesting that the mesa degradation and fracturing is recent, and possibly even ongoing.<br>
PSP_010366_2590	The polar layered deposits on Mars are thought to have been formed by recent climate changes, similar to ice ages on Earth.  This image shows an exposure of the north polar layered deposits, partly covered by bright frost.<br><br>The swirling patterns of layers are mostly caused by erosion, exposing the horizontal layers on ridges and valleys. However, the layers are not completely flat in this area. Below and right of center, layers are cut off against other layers in what geologists call an angular unconformity.  This unconformity shows that older layers were eroded before younger layers were deposited on top of them.  The entire stack was then eroded again to expose the unconformity.<br>
PSP_010369_2065	This image shows the scoured, upstream flank of an impact crater within the Kasei Valles outflow channel.<br><br>Kasei Valles forms one of the largest outflow channel systems on Mars thought to be carved by enormous floods over a billion years ago. The channel system flows first north and then east, cutting through the Hesperian-aged plains of Lunae Planum and Tempe Terra.<br><br>In this image, the channel has diverted around a crater‚Äôs rim forming a streamlined island that is located near the end of Kasei Valles where it terminates into the lowland plains of Chryse Planitia.  The scouring done by the channel flow is visible in this image.  However, the triangular-shaped headward extent of the streamlined landform proved particularly resistant to the erosive flow.

PSP_010434_1575	This image shows the intersection of a valley with the floor of a large impact crater. The valley appears to have transported sediment that was deposited on the crater floor when the flow slowed. As the eastern side of the lobate deposit appears to have been sheared off, it is possible that continuing flow from the valley eroded into its own deposits.<br><br>The deposit is noticeably different from the crater floor in HiRISE color, indicating that the valley transported different sediments. Since the large crater is shallow, likely due to infilling, this suggests that multiple sources of sediment and perhaps multiple deposition processes have affected the geology at this site. <br><br>The deposited material in the lobe at the valley mouth displays some interesting textural features. Small boulders are commonly present on its surface. This may demonstrate relatively energetic deposition as in a flash flood, although it is possible that the boulders are superimposed debris from later impact craters.<br><br>The southern end of the deposit is also fracturing into blocks or slabs. These could be relics of old mud cracks, or of thermal contraction cracks formed in permafrost. <br><br>
PSP_010446_1255	This image represents part of the dune field present in the northeast portion of Russell Crater. The dune field itself is roughly 30 kilometers long, and appears to have formed from windblown material trapped by the local topography.<br><br>This HiRISE image was taken during the southern hemisphere‚Äôs deep winter, where temperatures are low enough to allow the carbon dioxide frost to be stable.  The frost is apparent primarily on the slopes that do not experience full sunlight, and is the target of a long term monitoring program by HiRISE.<br><br>Most of the gullies in this image appear to originate near the crests of their respective dunes, and are present on pole-facing slopes. The gullies in this image appear to have only two of the three components of normal gully morphology seen elsewhere on Mars, since they seem to lack a debris apron at their terminus. They have defined alcoves, and have unusually long channels that do not seem to change significantly in width.  <br><br>Russell Crater is located in the southern hemisphere at roughly 53.3S and 12.9E, and is approximately 140 kilometers in diameter.<br><br>
PSP_010453_1675	This image shows cratered dunes and yardangs in the Medusae Fossae Formation, located in the Martian mid-latitudes and is characterized by wind-sculpted landforms. The composition of the Medusae Fossae is unclear but may include indurated (hardened) volcanic ash deposits or remnant dust-ice mixtures that formed during a different Martian climate.<br><br>The bottom half of the image reveals dunes that have apparently become cemented. The dune field is heavily cratered and both the dunes and craters exhibit much erosion and degradation indicating that they are relatively old in age. Most craters do not have visible ejecta deposits (most likely due to erosion and/or mantling (being covered)) and have superposed smaller dunes and ripples that also indicate that the craters and thus the dunes on which they lie are old in age.<br><br>Sharp ridges formed from wind abrasion, or yardangs, are visible in the upper half of the image. Yardangs typically form in dry, desert environments with strong prevailing winds that are unidirectional and carry an abrasive sediment load. Abrasive winds erode the surface into parallel elongate landforms, or ridges, that are often three or more times longer than they are wide.<br><br>When viewed from above, these landforms often resemble the hull of a boat. Yardangs typically form in easily-eroded material, most likely sedimentary rock or volcanic ash deposits that contain some amount of sand. Yardangs are found on both Earth and Mars.<br><br>
PSP_010533_1755	This image shows wind-eroded layered deposits in Aeolis Mensae, located close to the volcanic region of Elysium and near the boundary of the high-standing, heavily cratered southern hemisphere and the low, sparsely-cratered plains that cover most of the northern hemisphere of Mars.<br><br>Aeolis Mensae is well-known for its unusual features commonly related to wind activity on the planet‚Äôs surface. Several long, sinuous, and branching ridges have been exposed by wind erosion. Raised curvilinear ridges observed in this region, such as those shown here, are believed to be former stream channels now preserved in inverted relief. <br><br>On Earth, inverted relief occurs when formerly low-lying areas become elevated because the original depression is filled with materials, such as lava, that are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. In the case of stream channels, the stream bed may contain larger rocks and/or sediments that have been cemented by chemicals precipitating from flowing water, which remain while adjacent fine material is blown away by the wind. In this location, it is most likely that water once flowed through this channel and deposited sediments that eventually filled the channel and became cemented. Over time, wind eroded the surrounding surface leaving the remnant channels exposed as raised curvilinear ridges.<br><br>Surrounding the inverted channels are several shorter, linear, streamlined ridges oriented roughly south/north. These are yardangs or streamlined remnants of material shaped by the action of sand-blown sediments that eroded away weaker material. The orientation of the yardangs indicates the primary wind direction. Landforms such as these are common in desert areas on Earth. Portions of the larger curvilinear ridges appear to be eroding into yardangs.<br><br>
PSP_010536_2190	This image shows a part of the Nilosyrtis region of Mars, along the ‚Äúdichotomy boundary‚Äù which separates the southern highlands from the low-lying northern plains.<br><br>In this region, the boundary is actually a broad region of hills, knobs and mesas, with strange and exotic textures observed on the surface. This is among the northernmost parts of the boundary region; it is thought that under different climate conditions, ice is deposited from the atmosphere here, potentially forming significant glaciers. <br><br>Evidence for large-scale glacial flow is not obvious at this site, but many of the enigmatic surface textures may be related to deposition and removal of ice. The variety of textures includes areas with dense patterns of cracks, lumpy and pitted regions, and areas of small, pitted hummocks. Downslope-trending ridges in some places could indicate ice flow but may be due to more complex processes.<br><br>Many of the subtle breaks in slope in the area correspond to changes in the surface texture. The formation of many of these features is still not well understood in detail, but it is likely that much of this texture is due to deposition and removal of ice, some of which could still be preserved under a lag deposit of dust and rocks. For instance, polygonal fracture patterns commonly occur in ice-rich ground on both Earth and Mars. Similar textures occur in many parts of the Martian mid-latitudes and indicate past processes which have reworked much of the surface.<br><br>
PSP_010546_2615	Sand dunes are found in numerous locales on Mars. These dunes are in the north polar region. High latitude dunes are covered seasonally with carbon dioxide frost (dry ice).  <br><br>The <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010546_2615_cut.jpg'><strong>subimage shows a place</strong></a> where material has slipped from the crest of the dune and slid down to form a deposit at the bottom. The material may have been loosened by the activity associated with sublimation (evaporation from a solid to a gas) of seasonal frost.<br><br>
PSP_010567_2360	This image shows the wall of a crater in the Northern Lowlands that has several gullies incising it.<br><br>Although many gullies are located  between the latitudes of 35 and 45 degrees North and South, these gullies are located northwards of this latitude belt at 55.8 degrees N. How gullies formed remains elusive, although several hypothesis have been offered.  The main problem is that liquid water is not stable on the surface of Mars due to the present-day pressure and temperatures. Some possible gully hypotheses are that they are the result of a fluid (carbon dioxide or water), or they may instead be the result of dry debris flows.<br><br>The gullies in this image source from a similar distance from the crater rim and terminate down the slope in relatively bright deposits. They also have debris free alcoves and exhibit other features typically formed by water flow including a sinuous channel shape, channels that merge and split forming a braided pattern, and channels that extend out onto the debris fan deposits. <br><br>One possible hypothesis for the origin of these gullies is that the similar elevation of the gully sources below the crater rim may indicate that groundwater flowed out of the crater wall along a subsurface rock or soil layer. Salts and minerals in the groundwater may have allowed the water to continue flowing on the surface longer as a liquid. Continued flow would eventually erode the surface forming a gully.<br><br>
PSP_010569_1720	This image shows a small shield volcano in the eastern Tharsis region of Mars. The Tharsis region is located on the Martian equator and contains some of the solar system‚Äôs largest volcanoes. <br><br>The oval shaped depression in the center of the image is the summit pit of the volcano. Emanating from the summit crater, is a raised, leveed lava channel that branches downhill. Lava channels are narrow pathways through which lava flows on the volcano surface. The volume of lava in the channel can often fluctuate and sometimes lava will overflow the channel. When this happens, lava congeals and cools along the edges of the channel forming natural levees and building up the lava channel above the surrounding surface.<br><br>Shield volcanoes have shallow-sloping sides and get their name from their resemblance to a warrior‚Äôs shield. They form from basaltic lava that flows easily, or has a low viscosity, and builds up over time to form a broad shield volcano profile.<br><br>Some of the largest volcanoes on Earth, such as Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea of Hawaii, are shield volcanoes.
PSP_010589_1510	This HiRISE image shows an outcrop of material in a crater at the edge of Hellas Basin. Hellas is a massive impact crater, formed early in the history of Mars. It has a complex history that may have included episodic lakes and seas. <br><br>The deposits in this image may help unravel this history. The light band visible at low resolution is the edge of an outcrop of sedimentary rocks. Large-scale striping can be seen, probably corresponding to deposits of sand and dust on relatively flat parts of the outcrop. At full resolution, very fine bands or layers are visible in the light rock. These probably indicate small-scale layers, although it is possible that they are highlighted by trapped dust. <br><br>Although many processes can form finely layered rock, it is possible that these were deposited in an ancient lake or sea. Light deposits occur on other parts of the edge of Hellas, and lake sediments can form thin layers. In addition to deposition, these layers may also record erosion, since there are possible unconformities where one layer appears to cut off another, suggesting that the first was eroded (removed) before the second was laid down.<br>
PSP_010624_2045	This image shows the floor of a large impact crater in the northern lowlands of Mars. Near the image center is a small crater (roughly 300 meters across) with dark ejecta. This is a very fresh, young impact crater, probably formed by the impact of a small asteroid less than 20 m in diameter. <br><br>HiRISE reveals very fine details of the crater and ejecta. The most striking feature about the crater is the number of boulders around it. The largest boulders are as much as 9-10 m across, larger than a car. Many smaller boulders are also visible, down to the limit of what HiRISE can resolve. The largest boulders occur near the rim or have fallen back into the crater, while smaller rocks were thrown much further. No other crater in the image shows similar numbers of boulders, so this crater is much younger than the others. <br><br>Although this crater is quite young, it is not completely pristine, as it has been partially filled by dust. The smooth patches with faint patterns on the crater floor are most likely dust which has fallen out of the atmosphere. On the eastern (right) side of the crater, a few small dark streaks are visible; these are due to dust avalanches and are seen in many dusty areas of Mars. The other craters in the image have thick mantles of dust or sand on the floor, sometimes shaped into linear ripples.<br>
PSP_010630_2115	This image was suggested by Mr. Dennis Mitchell's 8th grade NASA team, Evergreen Middle School, Cottonwood, Calif., as part of the HiRISE Quest Student Image Challenge.<br><br>They write: "Located near Mamers Valles, this image shows numerous fluvial features that indicate this area was once rich with water. The lineated valley fill suggests an ice-rich soil. (Of particular interest) <a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_010630_2115_cut.jpg'><strong>is a small cone-like feature</strong></a> (located on the floor of a 2 kilometer diameter) impact crater  in the center of the enlarged image.<br><br>"At first this resembles a cinder cone volcano on Earth. However, when magnified, it reveals a ... feature (found in Arctic regions) on Earth called a pingo. These are caused by ice protruding through the soil creating a positive-relief geologic feature. If you examine the smaller craters in the surrounding terrain you'll see a checkerboard pattern in each one. These closely resemble melted pingos on Earth, again suggesting an area of Mars that was once rich with water." <br><br>While the student's suggestion that the mound-like structure is a pingo is reasonable, there is yet no scientific consensus for the origin of these interesting structures.<br>
PSP_010638_1890	This HiRISE image shows a part of the Cerberus Fossae, a long system of aligned fissures. The Cerberus Fossae were the source of the youngest major volcanic eruption on Mars that covered much of the surrounding area in lava. The region has also seen much other volcanic activity. <br><br>The walls of the fissures typically reveal lava layers. At this site, they have cut through an older hill that protrudes above the surrounding plains. The layers within the hill are tilted relative to the overlying rock, which appears to drape the region and runs continuously over the hill and plains. <br><br><a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010638_1890_cut.jpg'><strong>This tilted contact</strong></a> is known as an angular unconformity. It is most likely that this formed when horizontal layers were tilted by faults before the most recent volcanic eruptions, forming the irregular hills. The hills represent relatively old rock, while the smooth plains and the thin draping cover were formed more recently.<br>
PSP_010656_2170	A valley extends across the center of the image, and a tributary joins it from the north, while another branch connects from the south. This branch‚Äîwhich resembles half of a crater‚Äîis really just a bend in the channel, much more incised than the muted valley going across the scene.<br><br>There is evidence of mass wasting (gravity moving dry materials off high-standing regions onto low-lying regions), visible where a series of ridges appear to be piling up near the floor of the bend. <br><br>The terrain surrounding the valley has craters of a range of ages, judging by their different states of degradation. One small fresh crater near the right side of the image has dark, high-standing rays extending from it. A larger more degraded crater is located in the bottom third of the image. A great deal of material has flowed off the crater walls into its center. It is likely that ground ice aided the movement of this material.<br>
PSP_010661_1780	This image shows a small shield volcano covering Noctis Fossae in the eastern Tharsis region of Mars. The Tharsis region is located on the Martian equator and contains some of the solar system‚Äôs largest volcanoes. <br><br>Shield volcanoes have shallow-sloping sides and get their name from their resemblance to a warrior‚Äôs shield. They form from basaltic lava that flows easily, or has a low viscosity, and builds up over time to form a broad shield volcano profile.<br><br>The oval shaped depression in the center of the image is the summit pit of the volcano that contains a cooled lava pond. Emanating radially from the lava pond are several raised, leveed lava channels. Lava channels are narrow pathways through which lava flows onto the volcano surface.

PSP_010678_2135	This image shows the distal end of a set of braided channels west of Hecates Tholus. Hecates Tholus, a volcano, is located in the northern hemisphere of Mars and is the northernmost of three volcanoes within Elysium Planitia.<br><br>The Elysium volcanoes are believed to have experienced a more diverse volcanic history than that of the Tharsis volcanoes. In addition to numerous lava flow units, several observed channels have been interpreted as both volcanic and fluvial in origin.<br><br><a href='/images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010678_2135_cut.jpg'><strong>The braided channels in this image</strong></a> appear to have carved into young lava flows. Like braided rivers on Earth, they consist of a network of small channels, often separated by small streamlined islands. The morphology of the channels and the fact that they are braided and have streamlined islands has led to interpretations of a fluvial rather than a volcanic origin. Although the channels are heavily mantled by fine sediments, some appear to vary in depth. This, along with the presence of multiple channels, suggests that they may represent more than one episode of fluvial activity. <br><br>The water that potentially formed the braided channels may have been released due to igneous intrusions into ground ice or to the emplacement of lava flows on ice-rich terrain. Altogether, morphologies and landforms in the surrounding area indicate extensive volcano-ground ice interactions in the past. <br><br>
PSP_010679_2205	This image shows portions of the northwest and southwest rims of a northern hemisphere crater.  The northwest rim has gullies, features frequently proposed to be carved by <a href='/science_themes/fluvial.php'><strong>fluvial processes</strong></a> or debris flows.<br><br>The dark material on the crater floor is dust; some if it has been moved by dust devils to form the dark streaks visible here. <br><br>The scene has two main textures: smooth and pitted.  The smooth, mantling material is thought to be ice-rich. The pitted regions are thought to mark locations where the subsurface ice has been removed by sublimation, when ices convert directly to gas.<br>
PSP_010689_2025	This image of a region east of Tooting Crater is centered on a tectonic fissure west of the Olympus Mons Aureole. Three other channel systems formed along it.<br><br>The feature of note is a broad shallow channel system exhibiting a braided pattern that abruptly changes to a steep walled channel system near the fissure. These steep walled channel systems are thought to be formed when ground water flowing out along a cliff undermines the slope resulting in collapse of overlying materials. Erosion then typically moves in a headward direction along the pre-existing shallow channel system. This process is known as groundwater sapping. There are other places on Mars (such as Cerberus Fossae), where these fissures appear to have flood channels associated with them.  <br><br>Within this  channel there is a more resistant, cliff-forming layer near the surface with some defined horizontal strata (layers). Multiple dark streaks known as slope streaks originate from the base of this hard layer. Slope streaks are generally dark when first formed and then gradually fade over time.  The origin of these slope streaks is still under debate, but they are thought to be dry dust avalanches.<br><br>
PSP_010695_2225	This image is of a flow feature within Moreux Crater, located at 42N and 44.6E on the edge of Mars‚Äô highlands/lowlands boundary.  The crater itself is roughly 135 kilometers in diameter.<br><br>During the impact that forms craters, a roughly bowl shaped volume is excavated from the Martian crust. In craters larger than about 7 km in diameter, a central peak or mound forms on the floor of the crater. This image focuses on a portion of the Moreux central peak that apparently broke off and slid away, forming a type of giant landslide. <br><br>Interesting hummocks, swirls and ridges are found on the surface of the landslide. There are also distinct, almost circular depressions of unknown origin near the foot of the flow. Both light and dark toned dunes later formed on this landform.<br><br>
PSP_010710_1320	This image shows part of the southern wall region of Asimov crater (centered at -47S,5E) in Noachis Terra, located west of Hellas Planitia. This ancient crater displays an intriguing large trough-shaped feature (a.k.a. Noachis ring trough) that encircles the entire inner crater wall. <br><br> In this image,  the northern slope exhibits crisp-appearing gullies that appear to have sourced from jumbled, gravelly indistinct regions.  Some tributaries seem to originate in fractured bedrock.  The tributaries coalesce forming sinuous gullies that dissipate into the trough floor deposits.  Frost or ice covers much of this south facing slope. In contrast, the south  wall of Asimov crater seems to lack the pristine gully morphology evident on the trough slope to the north, but contains more distinct rock layers near the rim.  Gullies on the upper crater wall exhibit more of a debris chute morphology likely formed by the persistent erosion of the southern rim. These gullies coalesce into more channelized forms across the lower reaches, creating fans of sediment and debris before terminating on the crater floor below.  <br>
PSP_010744_1840	This image shows the southern edge of a large basin called Cerberus Palus, located in Elysium Planitia near Mars‚Äô equator.<br><br>The northern (top) half of the image depicts a small portion of a regionally extensive lava flow that ponded in Cerberus Palus. Where the surface texture of the lava is rough and ridged, the solidified flow-top crumpled and broke while the lava flow was still moving. Where the surface is smoother, it suffered less deformation prior to solidification of the lava flow.<br><br>Two distinct types of terrain dominate the southern (bottom) half of this image. The terrain to the west (left) consists of ejecta from an impact crater that predates the lava flow. Where this older ejecta blanket meets the lava near the middle of the image, the latter laps onto the former. <br><br>The terrain to the east (right) is more enigmatic.  It consists of a high-standing plateau fractured into large, often tilted blocks.  Along its northern margin (near the center of the image), this plateau-forming material appears to overprint the lava, and in the south-central part of the image, a tongue of lava emerges from underneath the fractured plateau. Two explanations are possible: either the lava flow was ‚Äúinvasive,‚Äù in that it burrowed under less dense material, or the plateau-forming material is even younger than the lava, which is known to have formed during the youngest period in Mars‚Äô geologic history, the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology_of_Mars'><strong>Late Amazonian.</strong></a><br>
PSP_010749_1325	A large dune field, still partially covered with seasonal carbon dioxide frost, shows evidence of movement of dune material. When the changes took place is not known. <br><br>Channels carved on face of dunes are <a href='images/2008/details/cut/PSP_010749_1325_cut.jpg'><strong>visible in this subimage.</strong></a>. Rather than going straight down the dune, the channels zigzag back and forth. The fluid or gas that carved the channel is an enigma. Older channels are filled in and ripples are visible there.<br>
PSP_010829_1880	This image shows part of a pedestal crater overlying a flat-topped ridge several degrees north of the Martian equator and just west of Meridiani Planum, the landing site of the <a href='http://marsrover.nasa.gov/home/'><strong>Mars Exploration Rover,</strong></a> Opportunity.<br><br>Part of a crater and its ejecta blanket (the deposit of debris that surrounds the crater, created by a meteorite impact on the surface of Mars) is visible in this image. The ejecta blanket is composed of materials which are resistant to erosion and coat surface material around the crater causing it to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Eventually, erosion of the topmost layers of the surrounding plains cause the crater and ejecta to appear as if standing upon a raised platform or pedestal. Features such as this on Mars are called pedestal craters. In this example, the eroding ejecta has ragged edges with some detached mesas and buttes and resistant layers in the ejecta are forming steep and overhanging cliffs.<br><br>Emerging from the rock beneath the pedestal crater is an inverted flat-topped channel. Similar to the pedestal craters, inverted channels occur when former channel depressions become elevated because materials that fill the depressions are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding terrain. For example, a depression may become filled with lava that is more resistant to erosion than the surrounding surface, or gravel or boulders transported in a high energy flow that protect underlying material from erosion, or sediments deposited by a flowing stream that have become cemented. <br><br>In this image, the pedestal crater superposes the flat-topped ridge indicating that it is younger and formed after the channel. Therefore the channel formed first, possibly a result of water flowing on the surface. Resistant materials were deposited on the flat channel floor and the channel was later filled and buried by sediments.<br><br>Even later, a meteorite impacted the surface of sediments above the channel forming a crater and ejecta blanket of resistant materials that protected underlying materials from being blown away and eroded. Over time, the topmost layers of the surrounding plains eroded due to winds or climate change or other factors leaving the crater and ejecta raised above the surrounding surface. Continued erosion also eventually exhumed and inverted the flat-topped channel in the rock layers beneath the crater.<br>
PSP_010854_1325	In the winter, these dunes in an unnamed crater east of Proctor Crater are covered with seasonal carbon dioxide frost (dry ice). In the spring, the frost gradually evaporates but lingers in protected regions. In this color image bright ice deposits in sheltered areas highlight the ripples on the dunes.<br><br>These dunes were imaged during the first year of MRO‚Äôs mission. Images taken now in the second Martian spring can be compared to the previous year to study interannual variability.<br><br>
PSP_010862_1880	<a href='images/2009/details/cut/PSP_010862_1880_cut.jpg'><strong>This impact crater</strong></a> is only about 5.5 meters (18 feet) across - tiny compared to the giant basins that scar most planetary bodies. This type of bowl-shaped crater is called a simple crater. It's "simple" compared to larger craters that have terraces, central peaks and rings, and other, more complex, shapes. <br><br>Why should we care about such a small, plain crater? One reason is that it's extremely young. The large craters we see on Mars are millions to several billion years old, but this crater formed between January 2006 and May 2008. That means it was only a few months to a few years old when HiRISE observed it. We know this because we have been studying Mars with multiple missions over a long time period, and we can compare images of the same area and detect changes. In this case, the <a href='http://www.msss.com/mro/ctx/index.html'><strong>Context camera</strong></a> on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took an image that had a dark spot in it. (To see the dark spot in the CTX image, look near the middle of <a href='http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/ctx/P19_008515_1880_XI_08N192W#start'><strong>this image</strong></a>, to the left of the central group of little hills.)  When this was compared to <a href='http://viewer.mars.asu.edu/planetview/inst/themis#/planetview/inst/themis/V18092020'><strong>a previous image from the THEMIS instrument</strong></a>, the dark spot wasn't there. Therefore, we know it must have formed between the dates those two images were taken.<br><br>The Context camera has a lower resolution than HiRISE, in order to cover more area. A single pixel is about the same size as this crater. So that Context image can't resolve the crater; all that's visible is a dark spot. When HiRISE followed up on the detection and returned this more detailed image, we could see that the dark spot is actually a much larger area surrounding this tiny crater. The dark area that allows us to detect these new impacts is probably the result of lighter-colored dust being blown off the surface by the impact event.<br><br>At this site, there are also some streaks of dark material that was ejected out of the ground. Using this higher resolution image, we can positively identify a new crater at the center of the dark spot.<br>

PSP_010888_2030 	This image covers part of the central uplifted region of an unnamed crater in Phlegra Dorsa. This complex crater is approximately 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) in diameter and is centered  at 23 N latitude and 176 E longitude.  The transition from a simple bowl-shaped crater to a complex crater exhibiting central peaks or pits, flat floors and terraced walls takes place in craters that are larger than about 15 kilometers (about 9 miles) in diameter on Mars. Because the central uplifts of complex craters expose rocks and materials that originated deep below the surface, researchers can use these regions as possible "windows" to view the rocks beneath the surface.<br>\tA northeast-southwest linear valley or trough transects this region dividing the uplift in two.  This valley, or lineation, may have resulted from processes occurring during the uplift event or subsequent to crater formation. When seen at HiRISE resolution the center of this valley seems to bisect what may be a small (less than a kilometer wide) central pit.

there are 3 of them	HiRISE imaged Opportunity on October 3, 2006, and November 14 and 30, 2006, and each time the rover was in a different location as it progressed around the crater. The remainder of the scene is unchanged, except that the shadows are slightly different given variations in the time of year and time of day between images. Also, each image was acquired with slightly different viewing geometries: MRO was pointed 3.84 degrees to the west for the first image, 16.3 degrees west for the second, and 1.76 degrees west for the third.<br><br>For more information about the first two images, see: ( http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/TRA/TRA_000873_1780/opportunity.html ).<br>The third image is PSP_001612_1780 and will be released in full when geometric processing has been completed. All three images are shown here in their original geometry, not reprojected to map format.<br>
TRA_000873_1780	This HiRISE image shows "Victoria Crater," an impact crater at Meridiani Planum, near the equator of Mars. The crater is approximately 800 meters (about half a mile) in diameter. It has a distinctive "scalloped" shape to its rim, caused by erosion and downhill movement of crater wall material. Layered sedimentary rocks are exposed along the inner wall of the crater, and boulders that have fallen from the crater wall are visible on the crater floor. The floor of the crater is occupied by a striking field of sand dunes.<br><br>Since January, 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has been operating at Meridiani Planum. Five days before this image was taken, Opportunity arrived at the rim of Victoria Crater, after a drive of more than 9 km (over 5 miles). The rover can be seen in this image, at roughly the "ten o'clock" position along the rim of the crater.<br><br><strong>Anaglyph</strong><br>HiRISE has imaged Victoria three times, and <a href='images/2007/details/cut/victoria-anaglyph.tif'><strong>shown is a combination of two of those views.</strong></a> <br><br>To see the topography, view this image through glasses with a red filter for your left eye, and a blue or blue-green filter for your right eye. The difference in viewing angle between the two images is about 12 degrees, greater than the convergence angle between the left and right eyes of humans while viewing distant objects, so the vertical relief appears much steeper than is actually the case. While some of the cliffs around the crater are in fact vertical, the slopes below the cliffs are no steeper than 30 degrees.<br>
