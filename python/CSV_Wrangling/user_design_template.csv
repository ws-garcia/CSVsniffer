# Old SQL Example Report Design Document
#
# Text not in quotes are column names from the SQL query
# Quoted text are labels that will appear in the report.
# Expressions like ( id + id ) * 10 below must be single 
# space delimited. So (id+id) will not parse correctly.
#
# NaN and Infinity are returned as zero. 
#
# Comments are lines beginning with a hash #. They are 
# stripped when this document is parsed.
#
# Values (either columns or expressions) are rounded by default. 
# To disable this set round_report_values to false in
# config/initializers/old_sql.rb. You can also change the
# precision, which is 2 by default.
#
# Tabs or spaces can optionally be used between "cells" for 
# ease of reading.
#
# All uppercase labels are bolded and converted to capitalized 
# words for the jqgrid, and HTML table report views.
